# CMPE-202 : System Software Engineering Project
This code is part of the system software engineering course project. The goal of this project is to demonstrate
 1. parsing of a certificate file
 2. Perform static Analysis on the code

## Parser
The parser code has 3 part
    - the main which has the options for generating different output
    - the parser code which parse the SCFFIle.tlv
    - print the parsed file in legible format

### compilation
To compile the code run `make all`
To clean the existing obj `make clean`

### Demonstrate key principles of programming
    - Static Analysis
    - Secure coding
    - coding guidelines
    - modularity
