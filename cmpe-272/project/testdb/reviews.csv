9835,3640746,2013-02-26,5143343,Michelle,"A beautiful house in a lovely quiet neighbourhood, which was only a 5 minute walk to our seminar venue at the Manningham Hotel.Nice parks around for a quick morning walk, buses & shops only a block away. Rate very reasonable too. Manju is a lovely lady who made me feel most welcome & comfortable. Will definitely stay again!
I also recommend Doncaster Shopping Town - WOW."
9835,23731188,2014-12-08,2478713,Karyn,"This was my first time using airbnb and it was great. I was going to a party in an area that didn't have much accommodation around and which was booked being Xmas anyway (and I would have needed to get a cab too) - so it was great to find a room within walking distance.

Manju the host was lovely and the room was as described. A very pleasant and easy experience as a whole."
9835,46588875,2015-09-12,26184717,Rosalind,I was visiting Melbourne to spend time with my son and daughter-in-law and their new baby but I needed accommodation. I was very pleased to find Manju’s house only 20 minutes walk away. Manju was a kind host and her lovely house is spacious and the bed very comfortable. Being able to watch tv upstairs was a bonus too. The house is in a pleasant neighbourhood and only a short walk to the bus stop. The bus takes a fast route into the city on the freeway which was a nice surprise.

Highly recommended!"
10803,3369053,2013-01-18,1763045,Julie,"Perfect isnt enough! Lindsay was the best host we could ever imagine help us a lot to handle our new start in australia. His place have a perfect location few second to the tram and 10 minute to cbd , close to a lot of restaurant and 2 park.

10803,3403930,2013-01-23,4423532,Ivonne,Living with Lindsay was very relaxed. The room is choosen in fantastic colours and the colours of the sheets fits very cool together with it too. Lindsay is a very helpfull person and he helped me a lot organisating my journey! 
10803,3514479,2013-02-11,4551787,Jess,"Beautiful home, great location very friendly and helpful throughout my stay!"
10803,3662039,2013-03-01,632036,Yvonne And Pip,"It was great staying at Lindsay's apartment. He's friendly and fun to hang out with over a bevie! The location could not have been betters itch the tram at the door step and CERES just around the corner. 

Thank you Lindsay for providing a great spacewith such positive vibe!!!"
10803,3908291,2013-03-26,2553303,Thomas,"Lindsay was an excellent host, his apartment is in a great location, only a few metres from the end of the Tram 96 stop. Room was spacious enough, my sleep wasn't disturbed by the passing traffic although I would advise very light sleepers to bring earplugs because of the non-stop beeping from the pedestrian crossing button. I enjoyed my time here."
10803,4046614,2013-04-05,5610658,Meredith,"Lovely room and home, and very gracious hosts. Lots of character, and I was made to feel right at home. Very close to tram stop and local cafe's, and walking distance from many restaurants. I would highly recommend staying with Lindsay!"
10803,4919670,2013-06-02,1836341,Mel,"A great room in a great location!  The room is very large with a tram stop right across the road.  It's also all within walking distance to yummy cafes, CERES and Sydney Road, Brunswick and only a few tram stops way from other cool areas like Fitzroy and Collingwood.  Lindsay was a very helpful and relaxed host who made my 3 week stay very easy and enjoyable.  Highly recommended! "

10803,5232675,2013-06-19,6553329,Hui Xin,Lindsay is a really kind and accommodating host! His place has really interesting decor too! He tried his best to tidy up his place fr us. The double room is spacious and warm with a really comfortable bed and clean toilet outside:) it's about 15min to town. 
10803,5388372,2013-06-27,6578448,Salomé,"Very  spacious, comfy and quiet room,
& lovely host.
Super convenient to get in town with the tram at the door.
Great !"

10803,9208537,2013-12-13,8378014,Mark,"Lindsay has a great living space over his yoga studio. The room is large and so is the bed. Very comfortable. It's at the end of the 96 tram line in Brunswick so easy access to the city and there are a few restaurants on his block so it's quite ideal. Lindsay is an unflappable sort of guy, easy to talk to, and I had a pleasant lunch with him the day I arrived. Strongly recommended. "
10803,9779148,2014-01-09,10719843,Joe,"I had a wonderful stay. Lindsay is very friendly, flexible and will get out of her way to help you whenever you need. Thank you for your hosting. "
10803,9903019,2014-01-18,10941298,Lea,I really enjoyed my stay at Lindsay's apartment and I would like to be able to write a better English to explain how Lindsay was very hepful for everything. When I arrived in Melbourne my English was bad and I think that I was lucky to start my journey in Australia with a friendly host and in the best suburb of Melbourne. (Plus the apartment is very close to the tram.)
10803,10193644,2014-02-05,10174200,Ljubek,Lindsay is relaxed and easy to get along with a pleasure to have a conversation with and in a convenient location.  I recommend staying here. Thanks again for hosting me.
10803,10535990,2014-02-24,11360615,Julie,"Lindsay is a very nice host: respectful and helpful.
The room is vaste with a king size bed : very pleasant!
The location at the end of the 96 tram line is perfect to go directly to the CBD (15 min) and to St Kilda Beach (45 min).
Highly recommended! Thank you Lindsay."
10803,10669420,2014-03-02,12407146,Djoni,"Staying for 4 days in Lindsay's house was an amazing experience. His earthy artistic beautiful house successfully brought us into a super-relaxing ambience that really helps my trouble-sleeping gone :)
Thank you Lindsay for having us.
John & Beth"
10803,15624617,2014-07-13,13599943,David,Lindsay was great. Really a sweet and extremely kind guy. I really enjoyed the month that I spent there. Great location (extremely convenient with the tram line).Was a great Melbourne experience.
10803,16143988,2014-07-22,2350539,Catherine,"Lindsay's home is easily accessible by public transport, close to everything. 
Very cool collector's items to look at, it's like stepping into a funky retro shop! 
I didn't spend much time at the house, as I was at a course. 
All in all, a good experience, thanks Lindsay!"
10803,16922336,2014-08-04,17961657,Lidón,"The location is very good and there are nice places really close where you can drink a coffee or dinner and lunch. Also, the tram 96 is just one minute from the house which is really convenient to go to the city or St Kilda. 
The room and the bed are very big but the kitchen was so dirty."
10803,17394586,2014-08-11,15035042,Jennifer,"Lindsay is a gentle soul and I felt very safe being in his home.
He was thoughtful and had the lamp and heater on for when I arrived which I really appreciated.
The location is perfect with the tram just outside the door.
The room was surprisingly quiet given the location and even the hotel directly opposite stopped their music just after midnight on Saturday so it wasn't a bother.
The room is spacious.
It is an old inner suburb property with the inherent narrow steps and old plumbing.  The kitchen, lounge and bathroom did not seem to have much spare space, but if you are not planning on sitting around inside all day it was a bed at a great price.

I found the bathroom probably needed some handiman love but I know landlords are not always as interested in tiles missing and broken taps as we are."
10803,17708099,2014-08-16,2838033,Jennifer,"Conveniently located near the tram stop. 
Comfortable room. 
Relaxed and friendly host who has an amazing aesthetic and interesting collectibles. "
10803,18042070,2014-08-20,19715778,Luise,"Lindsay was a fantastic host. 
The room was very clean and cute. Right next to the 96 tram and plenty of cafes. We felt very welcome from the start and were given a lot of privacy. The house was very retro and cute, highly recommend it."
10803,19417039,2014-09-12,3242826,Katie,All good. I loved looking at all your stuff and perusing your books.  
10803,19539476,2014-09-14,3242826,Katie,"Even though Lindsay  wasn't there when I arrived, he left a key and a note and everything was great.
Such a convenient place for the tram to get to the city.
"
10803,20247509,2014-09-26,467452,Jacques,"Great place, cool vibe, Lindsay's very easy-going and the room is comfortable. The bed is enormous. I would recommend. "
10803,21210727,2014-10-13,9607407,Christian,Conveniently located right next to the tram. A bar and cafes nearby. The room itself is quite nice with a big (relatively hard) bed. Didn't spend much time in the rest of the apartment.
10803,21492153,2014-10-18,19926893,Arijit,Good host. Very approachable. Nice room. Large comfy bed. 
10803,21664611,2014-10-21,1615354,Beau,"Lindsay was easy going and but also helped me out with whatever i needed. Very flex check in/out. Ace room firm bed,  lots of hot water, privacy. Was out alot and no probs with coming and going whenever.  city farm cafe round corner, 3 cafes down stairs, tram outside flat & runs right through the city to st kilda. ta very much!  "
10803,22596068,2014-11-10,22203261,Mai Stahl,"I have had the best time in Melbourne and was so pleased to stay at Lindsey's place. He is very friendly and helpful, and the apartment has an amazing atmosphere. I took advantage of the yoga studio downstairs, which I can highly recommend.
The location is perfect, close to the tram and with lovely cafés nearby.   "
10803,23290423,2014-11-28,9928374,Marina,"I think I could not add more to any previous reviews - the room is cozy, the bed is huge and comfortable, there are nice little cafes around and the tram is just few steps away. Good stay."
10803,23535741,2014-12-03,11929216,Callum,"Lindsay is a really lovely guy who definitely goes the extra mile e.g. installing the air con in the room just for me when it was starting to get pretty hot! As the other reviews suggest you can't go wrong here - comfortable, big room, private, excellently located. I didn't find street noise a problem at all. Thanks Lindsay!"
10803,23901968,2014-12-14,10479127,Mary,"Lindsay let out a string of mandarin sentences the minute I stepped in and faced him. That was really cool and impressive! We hit it off on a good note. He also re-read my profile to find out my interests and gave me tips on where to go to get the better art and music exposure in Melbourne. It really helped that he lives so near to all these wonderful places. I loved the room and apartment; it was all eclectic and vibrant. When I arrived, he had already provided me with guidebooks to interesting places in Melbourne. Very helpful! He provided me with two towels (That was really important) and gifted me a newsletter of comics, which was really kind and sensitive of him as he seemed attuned to my interests. Lindsay's location, I would say, was the best. It was easy traveling from home to all the difference places in Brunswick, Fitzroy, city, St Kilda and to the airport!!! Lastly, the icing on the cake was when I was allowed to have a look at his working studio. My stay in Melbourne was great, no less. 

I look forward to staying with him again if I visit Melbourne again! And if Lindsay ever comes to Singapore, I'd be glad to show him around :) Thank you, Lindsay!"
10803,25492396,2015-01-18,18889850,Jessie,"I stayed at the Cool Deco Apartment as a transition from moving to Oz from the US.  Lindsay was the absolute best host for this!  He gave me great advice and helped me find my way around.  The apartment was in a great location, literally the tram into the CBD(20min) and St. Kilda Beach (45min) was less than a minute walk from the doorstep.  For any yoga or capoeira enthusiasts, there was a lovely studio downstairs and outside there were two cafes, a bottle shop and a milk bar (small market).  It was an overall great experience - Thank you Lindsay!"
10803,25881941,2015-01-28,4433733,Eleanor,"The room is nice, and has everything you need - huge bed, air-conditioner, desk etc. Lindsay was a great host, very helpful and friendly but also gave me my own space. He even let me store my bike at his place for a few days after I left! Would definitely recommend this room to anyone. :-) "
10803,26127957,2015-02-04,24437267,Laura,I really enjoy the stay here. The room is cozy and comfortable. Linsday is a very nice person. The tram stop is very close and there are some nice cafes around. Highly recommended!
10803,28403279,2015-03-23,6138684,Tim,"Convenient location.
Yoga studio is great.
Can be a bit noisy from the road and the pub across the road. 
Bathroom was unclean as was the kitchen. Made me a little uncomfortable and I ended up choosing to eat out mostly. 
The host was nice though I didn't see him much. No one was there when I arrived and for the first week of my stay. 
House is super full of stuff and quite dark. An amazing assortment of oddities filling every available space.
Room was neat and had a desk and good internet. "
10803,30542413,2015-04-24,11137224,Liz,"Had a lovely stay for close to 5 weeks in Lindsay's flat in East Brunswisk. The bed was huge and comfortable, the noise from the street was only bad when there were roadworks happening right outside. "
10803,31140639,2015-05-02,27124822,Faye,"I only saw Lindsay twice, when I arrived and when I left. I arrived later than expected which he was fine with. The room is spacious and clean. The heater was on when I got there. The place was easy to find and very accessible. Only flaw was the bathroom, it was quite small and shower over bath. Still clean though! Would recommend if you're only looking for a place to sleep at."
10803,33937550,2015-06-02,24237220,Kieran & Nandini,"The room was quite nice, it has everything one would need, the bed is very comfortable and it was warm when I arrived. I didn't see Lindsay much (only briefly when I arrived) and didn't have a chance to say good-bye. I really liked the yoga studio downstairs and enjoyed a lovely class there. The room is clean and tidy. The rest of the apartment is not very tidy, there are stuff everywhere. Can't say the kitchen was very clean. The location suited me perfectly for my purpose to coming to Melbourne. There's a few nice place to eat very close to Lindsay's place. About the noise? Well I would guess that during the week the neighbourhood is relatively quiet, but I came on a week-end and the pub opposite was very noisy. I did enjoy my time there as it worked well for me, just needed a room to stay in. Thank you Lindsay :) Nandini"
10803,34186012,2015-06-06,18628532,Dan,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
10803,36803411,2015-07-01,4555262,Raquel,"I stayed at Linday's for a couple of weeks while i was looking for an apartament. He and her girlfriend were very friendly, although I didn't see them very much they were always willing to chat a little and provide everything that I needed during my stay. The room was very big, a bit cold but it had a little heater. The bed was huge and comfortable. Although the neighborhood is not that nice, the place was very well located with a tram stop literally at 10 meters. The city center was 20 minutes away. I would definitely stay at Linday's again, although I would try to avoid winter since the place had no heating haha Besides that everything was perfect!"
10803,38208795,2015-07-13,13836558,Adam,Nice room + Nice host = Nice stay! Thanks
10803,45056628,2015-08-31,3103278,Robbie,"The host made me feel very welcome in my time in Brunswick; he made a dinner (delish chicken curry) for me, and gave me lots of information regarding travel in the city and things to do. 

However, the problems with the room were multiple. Firstly, the room clearly had not been dusted in months. There were used condoms under the bed and underneath a cabinet. The amount of times the kitchen was tidy (ie. the space was useable and the sink was not full of dishes) could be counted on one hand. The bed was not a bed - rather, it was a futon that was incredibly uncomfortable to sleep on for more than one night. One morning I was confronted with a sink full of vomit - this had not been cleaned when I returned from work 8 hours later. A truly disappointing first Air BnB stay - I hope others in the future are not so negative."
10803,45978512,2015-09-07,40087101,Louise,"We stayed with Lindsay for 4 nights- the neighbourhood was great, and Lindsay gave us lots of good advice on places to eat and where to see live music etc. He also left travel guides and even umbrellas in our room which was much appreciated! We didn't see much of Lindsay throughout the trip, which made hanging out in his house feel a bit odd, but all in all there were no problems. "
10803,47160661,2015-09-16,27023590,Michael,"We stayed at Lindsay's place for 5 days to look for a new home. Although Brunswick itself wasn't to our taste, it was good having a tram stop into the city right outside the door. Only saw Lindsay a few times - he was quiet yet friendly and polite. "
10803,62334381,2016-02-14,21823541,Shi,That is a cool place and comfortable room! Good location too. Lindsay is friendly and polite. Told me a lot of cool places in Melbourne. That was a really nice stay!
10803,63230414,2016-02-21,24240942,Elizabeth,"The location of the accommodation is absolutely perfect. The tram stop is right in front of the door steps. 

The host is friendly and I was warm welcomed. 

The place is clean and nice and I can't complaint about anything. "
10803,63609754,2016-02-25,19689661,Alison,"We had a great stay at Lindsay's. We didn't see him much, but he was very friendly and told us about events going on around the city. The room was clean and has a very large bed. Also the tram outside was perfect for getting around and goes straight to downtown. No complaints! Wish we could have stayed longer! "
10803,66549908,2016-03-23,26006816,Ed,"Lindsay was a great host. Although he was not there when we arrived, he kept great communication prior to our arrival and made sure we knew how to get in to his very interesting, yet charming apartment. He arrived shortly after us getting in and answered our questions about the area, the city, etc. 

Brunswick East is a great spot, and Lindsays place is literally on the tram line that goes to the city centre, which is very handy, and not far from  some excellent bars and cafes - the pub across the road is really good, some great beer and live music.

Lindsay allowed us to extend our stay for an additional 4 nights, and also picked up mail for us after our stay had finished so that we could pop back and collect it. He stays out of your business, is very respectful of privacy and is very welcoming, allowing us to live in the flat as if it were your own home for your stay. Top host!"
10803,68170205,2016-04-02,62583967,Yuki,とても素敵な印象のお部屋でした｡ｵｰﾅｰと話をしたのも楽しかったです｡ｼﾃｨを散策したりしてﾒﾙﾎﾞﾙﾝが大好きになりました｡ありがとうございました｡
10803,68920614,2016-04-07,54470297,Archie,Lindsay made me welcome and my room was fine.
10803,71027991,2016-04-23,23680669,Sanya,Lindsay was a great host. He made us feel very welcome. The location is excellent and very accessible to the tram station! The room was also very cosy. Thanks for having us Lindsay :) 
10803,72974516,2016-05-06,66435294,Le,"Autumn in Melbourne is much colder than we expect. On the night we arrive, Lindsay provided a nice heater for us stay at nights. He not only provided tourist information for our reference but also led us a stylish Jazz bar and local Ozi brunch shop. In addition, his room is much bigger than the pic, and living room is well decorated with full of his dreams and imaginations. We both were feeling lucky to meet him and live his house. He is definitely a great and considerate host i have never met before. Nice meeting you and all the best there, Lindsay. "
10803,79330285,2016-06-12,66656100,Danielle,"Lindsay was wonderful and is honestly a very nice person. The room was perfect, clean, and so comfortable. He provided information on things to do around town, places to eat, etc. He even accommodated to my vegan diet by suggesting some wonderful vegan restaurants! So kind. He was also very out of the way, and I had plenty of privacy. The location is absolutely perfect being right next to the tram that goes to the city. I have absolutely no complaints. :)"
10803,81419282,2016-06-22,66043893,Rachel,"Great location & Lindsey is nice - he offered to share his coffee each morning & let me do a load of laundry (no dryer) BUT the space was dirty.  If food dishes being left out overnight & obvious dust piles on the floor & not fresh smelling sheets don't bother you then proceed.  Yes it's funky as described but a little more consideration for guests when it comes to simple floor sweeping,wiping dried toothpaste off the sink & cleaning dishes would have been nice.  
There were obvious stains on the sheets & pillow cases and as I was leaving 2 more guests were arriving while he wasn't home, so I'm pretty sure he didn't wash the sheets for them.  I stayed at friends hotel room 1 night to be in a clean bed.  
"
10803,83960302,2016-07-04,26881617,Laurice,"There was a glitch at the beginning as airbnb's routine reminder email didn't reach Lindsay and he wasn't expecting me. However, he responded promptly to my phone call and we were able to sort out a satisfactory solution. The room was exactly as described, and very warm and welcoming. I found the kitchen a little daunting, but that's not unusual for me. I enjoyed my stay in the room, and liked  chatting with Lindsay when we happened to be there at the same time. The flat is character-filled and interesting, and the neighbourhood suited me. Having trams and buses right outside was fantastic, and there was no obviously disturbing noise factor - even the pub music stopped at a reasonable hour."
10803,94209087,2016-08-15,2328290,Mohamed,Lindsay was a great host. He made me feel comfortable and we had great conversations.
10803,96055010,2016-08-21,43066312,Callum,"I stayed at Lindsay's place for 6 days with my girlfriend and it honestly couldn't have been a more perfect place to call home during our stay. The location is fantastic, tucked away in a funky area of Melbourne with a tram right outside and a great café next door. The room was clean, appealing and warm. Comfy bed and plenty of space to stash our luggage and settle in. Lindsay is very friendly and helpful, offering advice on transport before our arrival. He also left us a list of recommendations for art, music and food. While we were out a lot checking out Melbourne, it was always a delight to come back to the flat and hang out in our room or cook a meal the kitchen. We felt that we had a lot of privacy in our room and Lindsay was often out but always contactable. The flat itself is very cool with a tonne of character from all the found objects that Lindsay collects. There is even a yoga studio downstairs and managed to get a session in one morning. 
Really cannot rate this place enough. Highly recommended."
10803,97045380,2016-08-25,88991190,Theo,"Lindsay's place was really great if you want to stay in a place that is full of curiosities and odd bits and bobs.  Fantastic location, so so close to public transport was basically on the doorstep! It was really great Lindsay was reachable via text, and gave me my own space. Free wi-fi is always great! Thanks for a pleasant stay! :) "
10803,112354409,2016-11-05,2598731,Hannah,"I stayed at Lindsay's place for a month after moving to Melbourne.  For me, the location was great, close to the tram to Uni of Melbourne and after I bought a bike there was a safe, signposted path through back streets and bike paths.  There is also the Merri Creek nearby if you want to be in nature for a bit.  The house and room are exactly as described. It can get a bit cool but there is a heater in the bedroom. The bedroom was freshly cleaned. In the rest of the house there was a bit of dust and crumbs but it doesn't smell bad or anything like that. Lindsay was a helpful and accommodating host and always responded promptly to any queries I had if he wasnt at home. I recommend!"
10803,122489812,2016-12-23,103899318,Brigitte,"Lindsay was a very nice host. The room was just as we expected & very comfortable. Lindsay was really helpful in giving us advice on places to visit in Melbourne, including many cultural pamphlets and area guides. The check in was really easy and everything was prepared for us. 
The apartment was really cosy and had a nice atmosphere. It was also only a few metres from the tram stop which was really convenient for us. 
"
10803,129268632,2017-01-29,803565,Erwin,"Lindsay is a great host and this room is in an ideal location (across the street from a tram stop that runs frequently... even all night on weekends!). I'd definitely stay here again.

There's a cafe downstairs (Awkward Mike's) run by some charming guys, but you can skip the pizzeria next door (though it works for late night dining -- open til 11pm). Milkwood (cafe restaurant down Nicholson) and New Day Rising (on Blyth) are also great. There's a small convenience store (including alcohol) across Nicholson.

Keep in mind that there is a live music venue across the street, so if you're a light sleeper this might keep you up.

Being at an intersection, there were times when fumes idling at the traffic light would seep into the room, so this is something to keep in mind for people with respiratory issues."
10803,131936098,2017-02-14,40659718,Michelle,"Lindsay, and his place, were very accommodating to my circumstances and busy schedule. Commuting into the city was extremely convient and my room was big, comfortable and air-conditioned."

10803,148071589,2017-04-29,124784359,Teresa,"Very hospitable and helpful host. Great access to tram network straight to the city. Lyndsay was really helpful in providing instructions on how to get there from the airport, and what to do in Melbourne."

10803,183632566,2017-08-18,50768079,Kajia,Very good place with a really big bed and nice location closed to 96 tram stop. Lindsay is kind and helpful who has a good knowledge about China and mandarin. I would recommend the pizza restaurant downstairs if you wanna get something cheap and delicious for dinner.
10803,191023699,2017-09-06,30306884,Maria,The house has its own character and the location is super convenient. Lindsay is  a communicative and helpful host during my stay.

10803,203328093,2017-10-15,71026585,Alana,30 meters from Tram line 96 - one of the most convenient  tram lines running through Melbourne. Bout 20 minutes from Brunswick Street.

10803,212041346,2017-11-15,83691622,Nathalie,"Chambre spacieuse avec clim ( bruyante mais efficace ) dans un appartement personnalisé par Lindsay. Emplacement parfait ( tram 96) juste en bas de l entrée, 20mn pour le centre ville, 30mn pour southern cross, à peine 1h pour st kilda en ligne directe !! Parfait pour aller partout !"
10803,223842989,2018-01-01,144382914,Sandeep,Good location and value for the price.
10803,226464457,2018-01-10,7232324,Nico,"Everyone one with an alternative and more natural vibe will like Lindsay’s apartment very much. Because there is a YOGA-Studio in the house, Yogies may enjoy just falling out of bed into the really nice studio and then head off to have wonderful breckie in Melbourne."
10803,228459638,2018-01-19,6296021,Nicole,Awesome place to stay. Nice quiet location with a great cafe down stairs. Fantastic value for money. Would definitley stay again.
10803,229310799,2018-01-22,166028143,Delphine T,"Really good location, nice suburb. You are literally at the tram stop when you go out of the apartment. The bedroom is big and comfy, there is an air conditioner, so not too hot. 
Only thing was the kitchen, pretty small and not too convenient. 
But Lindsay is really nice, gave me tips and things to check nearby and in the CBD!
I recommand it!"
10803,230047707,2018-01-26,149486515,Marleen,"Our stay at Lindsay's was okay. Lindsay is a nice guy, who gave us some nice recommendations on where to go. He was easy reachable and polite. His place is quircky, which I liked, lots of interesting art. I did not so much enjoy using the kitchen as it was dirty. Lots of stickyness. Our room was okay, but could also have been a lot cleaner (dusty and some unwelcoming stains in the bedsheets). The bathroom was not as bad as the kitchen, the shower seems relatively clean."
10803,237666646,2018-02-23,44351195,Gini,"Lindsay is a nice and supportive host. He was trying to help me with a few things like pumping up the tyre of the bike. Unfortunately, I couldn’t stay there for two months as I have planned because of the noise and I am not a special case of noise sensitivity (I used earplugs all the time)!!! I had to left this place because of the noise. It is just at a really busy intersection and the old house has no insulation at all. The street goes literally through the house. Also, he bribed me to not say anything in this review about the noise and in return he would have given me a refund of one week. Poor behavior!!!! As I am an honest type, I rather want to tell the truth about Lindsay and his place for future guests. I would have appreciated the same. The apartment doesn’t look like as the pictures say. It is dirty, dusty (especially in the kitchen) and full of mould (especially in the bathroom on the shower curtain). Apart from all that it is cheap and for a couple of days maybe a good option."
10803,241365760,2018-03-09,67884812,Xl,"I recommend this place to stay because its great location, easy to get access to the city, near Lygon and Sydney road where you will have many good restaurants, also Lindsay is a hospitable host who is willing to give help and guidance. Overall it is very good impression for the first several days in Melbourne."
10803,247254208,2018-03-27,170305461,Nicola,Very pleasant apartment with easy travel to city centre (tram runs every few minutest from right outside the door). Host very helpful and friendly without being too intrusive. Highly recommended.
10803,248167191,2018-03-30,3531119,Tanner,"I really liked the space, really nice decor. For some being right up near a main Street might be an issue. But I loved having the tram literally a step outside the door. And the traffic noise didn't bother me.

Lindsay is also a very considerate easy going host."
10803,250088608,2018-04-03,32333782,Jing,The landlord was very good. I lived in his house and took good care of me. I took a long time to take a bath. The landlord short his time and gave it to me. I was very touched. I was reported to the local tour group. I was late in the morning and the landlord drove me in and drove me on time. I was able to catch up on time and provided a great help for my travels. He was a trustworthy person.
10803,250993314,2018-04-07,2643124,Bruno,Place was in a very convenient location close to some nice eateries. Not for light sleepers however as the street can get a bit busy. Liked the art deco bits and grungy feel of the place.

10803,265364812,2018-05-17,159535019,Guat Siew,"Lindsay would go all the way out to help me and make sure I had a pleasant stay and a great time visiting Melbourne by giving me advices and tips on everything. He always tries his best to answer honestly and truthfully.

The place is very convenient, short tram ride to CBD and well decorated with lotsa interesting small details. Great value for money. 

I’d highly recommend his place and definitely will rebook his place when I come back to Melbourne again. 

Best host I’ve ever known so far. "
10803,266959518,2018-05-21,10935397,Jgor,"Lindsay is a nice host, his place is very simple but perfect if you are on a low budget. Very well connected to the city and in a great spot to explore Brunswick and it’s surroundings. Make sure you check out “Ceres” just around the corner, it’s a pretty special place!"
10803,268727339,2018-05-25,190258729,Gregory,"Very handy location if you need to head into Melbourne CBD.
I found it a comfortable and peaceful place to stay, and was not disturbed by street noise.
The room is a generous size. The  decor is true to the listing, with the ""funky vibe"" and an intriguing mix of objects.
I was glad to have a desk and chair in the room to do some work at.
Lindsay is very accommodating and helpful with any queries."
10803,273073358,2018-06-05,44124419,Erin,Lindsay’s the best Airbnb host ever! We had so much fun staying in his place. Great location and excellent tips from Lindsay. We really enjoyed staying at his place and plan on coming back in the future! Mahalo Lindsay! 
10803,283428256,2018-06-30,179513340,Leonard,"Lindsay’s place isn’t modern but it’s clean, tidy and retro. Value for money."
10803,319989971,2018-09-08,46195242,Ping-Song,"Lindsay is an excellent host, a huge helper to me. I  adore the vintage decor style and also there's almost always a light, pleasant scent of incense floating from the yoga studios downstairs."
10803,333891142,2018-10-07,32372254,Melissa Ann,"I stayed in Lindsay's space for one month - We didn't see much of each other, both being busy and consistently on the go, or retreating to our rooms to wind down, though when we did cross paths (usually in the kitchen), Lindsay was friendly, warm, and helpful. 
The location is great; there are two cafés right downstairs (one has vegan friendly food options), also there is a pizza place right downstairs as well if that's your jam, nomnomnom; about a 7 minute walk west on Blyth there is Merri Creek bike/walk/running path which is beautiful; if you go east on Blyth towards Lygon and Sydney, you end up in the heart of Brunswick - Tons of restaurants on Lygon, all within walking distance, and an IGA Express if you need little groceries - If you keep going to Sydney road (a bit more of a walk) and go south, more restaurants, more cafés, better grocery stores, some OP shops, and Barkly Square with a K-Mart, Coles, and other little stores; if you take the tram north (stop right in front of Lindsay's) you are brought right into the CBD where there are restaurants and shopping galore. Lindsay is very helpful if you have any questions! 
I also brought my own bicycle from Canada, and was able to lock it up out back without worry as there is a solid gate. 
*As mentioned in the listing*, the space is on a busy street so if noise bothers you, do bring ear plugs. I was totally fine, but a light/fussy sleeper would notice this, especially with a pub right in front. 
Thanks again, Lindsay! It was a pleasure!"
10803,338573388,2018-10-20,190791260,Martin,"very nice place to stay, with the tram if you have a myki out side or a nice hour walk into the city. Lindsay was very helpful with places to go eat or drink"
10803,340135544,2018-10-23,117421771,Alvin,"excellent host; the location is quite convenient as the place is directly within steps of the tram; yeah, value for money."

10803,344129941,2018-11-02,122471750,Tatiana,Very nice and clean place. Hightly recommend it )
10803,348444786,2018-11-13,145498403,Sam,"Cleanliness is an issue. Dust, clutter and rarely an empty sink or hob not with leftover food on it... for days on end. Dishes, cutlery and cooking utensils will probably always need to be cleaned prior to use. You will be requested not to spend longer than 5 minutes in the shower, on multiple occasions. And can be a dark and dinghy place as blinds and curtains are regularly closed. It is right outside a tram stop which is convenient but also noisy at night, also opposite a pub, which plays live/loud music on weekends which could be a problem if looking for an early night... some earplugs will do the trick and probably why there were a few still under the bed from previous guests.
Having said this, if you are happy eating out, not looking to spend much time in the flat and just looking for a cheap bed/private room in a good location then this is a good place to stay. The location is great. Cool old style apartment but needs a good professional clean and tidy up."
10803,349610018,2018-11-18,49369979,Kenneth,"Great cosy room in an awesome apartment that gave me bohemian vibes. Very great location by the 96 tram, easy 20 mins into the city. Would stay again."

The apartment is pristine and everything about the apartment is top notch.  Vince and Frank are very helpful and answered all of my questions.

There is a great little cafe on the ground floor which was always handy for breakfast! We just loved staying here although we had a bit of trouble with the fob for the elevator which was extremely temperamental! Also had problem with wifi but Vince sorted this out very quickly. Would totally recommend this apartment for any couple, it was fantastic and we could have easily stayed for another week!!!"
12936,60598188,2016-01-25,24777798,Dave,"Nice apartment with chill, nice neighbors. Frank & Vince were incredibly easy to book with. The space was nice. 
Some nice restaurants / bars just on the corner and up Fitzroy st.
Little bit disappointed in the ground floor cafe being shut down .. but there's a couple others up & down the street.

Frank and Vince were very responsive and helpful when I couldn't figure out how to get the stove started and they immediately came by to help out. The apartment is also in walking distance to supermarket and numerous pubs and restaurants and is very lively in the evening.
12936,288476302,2018-07-10,80441458,Lachlan,Great spot and great hosts. Cheers guys.
12936,341813673,2018-10-28,9079186,Devin,Frank and Vince's place is fantastic. Location is great with good places to eat and trams stop to the city. St Kilda beach is 10 mins walk away. You can have your morning or evening walk to see sunrise or sunset. Everything you need are all there and a few spare just in case. They are so thoughtful in preparing the places for us. The carpark space was another great point for those who rent a car during their stay. checkin process is simple and fast. I would definitely go with their place again. 10/10.
12936,346002185,2018-11-07,17854449,Ivan,"Instructions could be better, not my fav place to stay. The place has a strong odour which I didn’t like."

15246,17586444,2014-08-14,18272013,Martin,Really nice spotless house and in a great location. Enjoyed my stay.
15246,17970964,2014-08-19,19550995,Sue,Eleni's house was the perfect stop for me! The neighbourhood was quiet and yet close to trams and walking distance to city amenities. Eleni is a welcoming and generous host and the room was spacious and the bed super warm and comfortable! Breakfast was a nice surprise and I felt right at home and welcome to be part of the family for my stay! 
15246,18374756,2014-08-25,1340345,Stuart,"I had a very pleasant stay with Eleni. Very comfortable house and room with all I needed, including a desk. Eleni and I also had some interesting chats. Overall, highly recommended. "
15246,18757745,2014-08-31,16969619,Stuart,I spent three days at Eleni's home which was relaxing and comfortable. I appreciated her warm welcome and the use of her bike that enabled me to explore Ceres Park and nearby shopping precincts. I left feeling refreshed and ready for the next part of my journey.  I certainly have nice memories of my time at Eleni's home. 
15246,19157724,2014-09-07,695339,Jong Soon,"Had a very pleasant stay at Eleni's place. She was kind and accommodating, she even waited for me although i arrived really late after midnight. Would love to be back again."
15246,22424640,2014-11-06,7784251,Stephen,"I stayed with Eleni for about three months while I was studying in Melbourne for the semester on exchange. She was very helpful in introducing me to the city and was always up for a chat whenever I was around, always recommending me new places to visit, and sights to see. I really enjoyed how welcomed I was here. The place to close to three different trams (the closest being 5 minutes, the others up to 15 minutes), which provides a great connectivity to different parts of the city. I would highly recommend staying here."
15246,25342737,2015-01-12,12687513,Petra,"Eleni is a very friendly and kind,  flexible and warm person. I felt at home immediately. She has a lovely house in a quiet environment. I slept in a spacious room. I can recommend this address in Melbourne North to everybody."
15246,25636335,2015-01-21,25341327,Heidi,Eleni was welcoming and accommodating. I had a friend join me in the stay at the last moment and it was no hassle for Eleni. I felt at home and comfortable in her home. Breakfast was lovely too! I'd happily stay with Eleni again.
15246,25859453,2015-01-27,25861528,Suzie,"Unfortunately the listing photo was not accurate. The room consisted of two single beds not the double bed. I was disappointed as I specifically searched for a room with a double bed. Eleni was polite and efficient. The house was very clean and tidy. For the price it was very good, but I would of liked a double bed. "
15246,26109397,2015-02-03,24981054,Dan,"Eleni was a friendly and interesting host - she made me feel welcome and included in her home. She has plenty of information about the local area and Melbourne in general. My room was spacious, had a desk and good wifi signal. 

The house is located on a quiet street. Shops are about 15 mins walk and trams about 10 mins.  The trams go straight to the city so it is a simple journey. 

I have no hesitation in recommending Eleni's home. "
15246,26271513,2015-02-08,13627654,Tim,"A very pleasant place to stay. Eleni was welcoming, helpful and considerate: I enjoyed that muesli, and your special yoghurt! The room was good, with one window looking on to the garden and another shielded by a curtain to diffuse the warm sun. Everything was fine; if you could move Thornbury a bit closer in, it would have been perfect!"
15246,27062286,2015-02-24,25921733,Amir,"I had a great time staying at Eleni's.
Eleni is a very friendly and accommodating host, she took me to shops and cafes and concerts. I also had a premium Aussie barbeque at Eleni's.
This is a very peaceful place at nights and beautiful at days.
I definitely recommend staying at Eleni's fabulous house."
15246,36258604,2015-06-27,26576285,Tabitha,"I had a lovely time staying at Eleni's. The house is very lovely and my room was light, comfy and spacious. It's in a quiet area but is still very conveniently located. Eleni immediately made me feel welcome in her home and was very helpful. She went out of her way to point out important places near the house such as the nearest shops and bus and tram stops when I arrived. She also does beautiful paintings that are hung up around the house. I very much enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to anyone. Eleni is very kind and easy going in general and a great host! "
15246,51109975,2015-10-18,21130603,Buddhika,"I stayed almost 4 months at Eleni's calm and quite place. Eleni was very kind, friendly and helpful lady , was understanding and welcoming my needs. It was a fantastic place and I always felt like I was living at home. Further, it was an unmemorable period as I could learn lot of things from her like few cooking tips ;), places to visit in Australia,  decorating houses. The place is ideal for any one who wish to move around CBD as all the transport modes are nearby the house.

I would recommend this place any one who wish to stay in Melbourne."
15246,53325507,2015-11-08,38549757,Tyronne,It was my first time in Melbourne and I had a lovely time staying at Eleni's. Her house was in a convenient location and just 20 minutes away from the city. The room was as described and clean. She was friendly and kind enough to point out important places near the house such as shops and tram stops. We had interesting discussions about unpredictable Melbourne weather :).  Thank you Eleni for your hospitality. Would highly recommend her place. If your place is available hope to see you next year. 
15246,54089400,2015-11-16,1440941,Christine,"A charming home with a charming host. Warm creative cozy cottage in quiet neighbourhood within easy walking distance of public transport trams and rail, cafes, yoga studios, art galleries, riverside walks - so much to explore in this up and coming area.

Good clear communication and everything as described even though the room I had booked was not available when I got there.
Highly recommended."

The room is spacious, the bed is very comfortable and there are two windows with great lighting - one gets you to the balcony.

The house is very cosy and I felt really good all the time. There is a great vibe in her house!

Eleni was very available for every type of questions and concerns about coming and moving to Melbourne. During my visit we had good conversations. I would recommend this place to everybody. "
15246,65547198,2016-03-15,56032013,Ernesto," Für mich war es die Erste airbnb Erfahrung. Und es war eine gute Erfahrung. Habe mich bei Eleni sehr wohl gefühlt. Es war als würde man bei der Verwandtschaft bleiben. Würde jederzeit wieder hier bleiben.

15246,146180409,2017-04-21,67128214,Bernadette,"We enjoyed ourselves at this home. Very comfortable, close to the trams line 11 and 86, also the train line. And lovely quiet neighbourhood with some great coffee venues close by. We would recommend 'The Breakfast Club' and 'Barry'."
15246,148103711,2017-04-30,15597357,Adam,"Eleni's place is very clean, tidy and modern without losing its homely touch. From the moment I arrived until the day I left I felt comfortable and happy to be living there. Eleni respected my privacy when I needed it, and was always up for a quick chat when I was feeling sociable. Would gladly stay again in the future!"
15246,152337524,2017-05-15,129550597,Hao,"That's a really good hospitality to be in Melbourne, clean and organized. And I am so grateful to host being confident to me. Nice lady Eleni is."

You ring the bell and you are received by a gentle host, Colin, who really makes you feel comfortable and leaves you privacy as well. Everything is very clean and operating. Living in that historic building with its high ceilings is like living in a castle. Always again!"

a recommander"
16760,1317996,2012-05-21,2156538,Elisabeth,"Colin presents himself as a true gentle man and I found him, together with Cheung, to be welcoming hosts; most thoughtful in matters of comfort.
A terrace type home built in 1888 and close to public transport.
Moreover, I was able to find a safe park for the SAAB nearby. Good not to worry about it."
16760,2393739,2012-09-24,3312020,Derek,"Clean & comfortable accommodation,excellent value for the price,close to public transportation & shops or restaurants. With the weekly pass for the trams & trains I had no trouble commuting over a large area of Melbourne easily from Colin's BnB. The one day I rented a car it was easy to pick it up from Avis on Chapel St. Hosts went out of their way to assist whenever they could. Definitely helped make my stay in Melbourne a memorable one. Would stay again."
16760,2923375,2012-11-19,2186418,Joy,"Colin is located just a block away from where I needed to be and it was perfect.    A quiet room (double glazing) with a comfortable bed gave a good sleep.    In the morning, the breakfast table provided a wide variety to choose from with coffee to kick start me on my journey.   Interesting conversation with fellow travellers at the table.   Colin was attentive to details to make my trip enjoyable.   Thank you Colin and Chung."
16760,3093171,2012-12-15,3253979,Anouck And Adrien,"The house is very comfortable, and clean, and there's also a pretty little garden! The bedroom has everything that you need and plus you have your private bathroom. Colin and his partner are really nice people.
You just should know that it is a real bed and breakfast house, it was not really clear to us following to the AirBnb advert, so we were a little bit disappointed about some points during our stay there.
But, except this misunderstanding, we have enjoyed our stay in this quiet place and we recommend it."
16760,3131809,2012-12-21,336664,Sharon,I enjoyed my stay.  Colin and Chung were lovely and very helpful.  The room was also lovely and the bed very comfortable.  Extremely well located with everything Balaclava and St Kilda has to offer close by.  Highly recommended.  Thanks Colin and Chung!
16760,3479925,2013-02-05,4162110,Jerome,Colin and Chung are very nice people. Chung is chatty and friendly and made sure my stay was comfortable. The house itself is beautiful. The room that I stayed at is spacious and has a great view of the street outside. 
16760,3704923,2013-03-05,325766,Jehan,Our stay was wonderful and the apartment was perfect. The location has easy street parking and was walking distance to St. Kilda nightlife.  I would definitely stay here again.

Colin and Chung were very helpful during our stay. We would highly recommend the place."
16760,4165035,2013-04-15,5021276,Wadim,"Conveniently located (Chapel Street for tram, Balaclava station for train) and close to food of all kind. Room spacious, could use a table, but the lounge downstairs is big and comfortable. Clean, warm and friendly host, whom I did not see much because I left early and arrived late. Good place to stay for a person who needs a 'place to sleep'. And thanks for the internet!"

The room is large, warm and comfortable with a private bathroom next door. Colin and Chung were easy to talk to and were helpful. A good base for exploring Melbourne."
16760,5376172,2013-06-27,2186418,Joy,"Repeat visit to Colin's home provided quiet accommodation, with the freedom to return when required to fit in with hospital visits.  Colin promptly replied and was kept informed of my requirements which met my expectations.   A considerate host..."
16760,7423735,2013-09-19,5990051,Kyle,"Colin and Chung were gracious kind hosts. Their home is clean, quiet, and charming. We had free “come and go as we needed” access. Their home was centrally located to all that we needed. Chung suggested we visit the penguins at Kilda Pier which we decided to do….it ended up being an amazing evening! They also were helpful in other travel suggestions. I would recommend this stay."
16760,7894550,2013-10-07,3933317,Avner,"I was looking for a place to lay low until I find a new job and new apartment so stayed with Colin and Chung for 10 nights. I have to say I absolutely loved my stay at their house.
My room was specious and I had a lot of privacy which is important to me. I was even lucky to get invited to dinner with the guys. Chung is an ex-cook and prepared his homemade spring roles in a Vietnamy's broth. It was delicious!
I know St Kilda very well but for those who don't - the house is located in a great spot with access to lots of places and activities.
I will definitely stay with Colin and Chung again if I was looking for a room."
16760,8226518,2013-10-21,6706690,Rosie,"A wonderful host, kind and giving. Always open for a chat but very willing to give me space as I was in Melbourne for work. I was able to come and go as I pleased and was helped out with sights, streets and places to see. Their home is a warm and room and bathroom were clean and very private. Would recommend them to anybody traveling to Melbourne, St Kilda. "
16760,8929021,2013-11-26,9165439,Anne,"We loved our staying in Melbourne with Colin and Chung. It was our first time to stay via Airbnb so we were surprised how smoothly everything worked. Very friendly hosts, Chung was always around when needed, but same time left lot's of free room for doing things by ourselves. Thanks for cooking together and sharing Vietnamese reciepts! Got also lot's of tourist tips about Melbourne. Hope to see you some day again. Anne and Alvar from Estonia"

There is nothing negative to mention. Highly recommended!

16760,9121034,2013-12-08,10325711,Sue,A very comfortable room in a very convenient location. Hosts were friendly but not intrusive. A very pleasant stay. Thankyou. 
16760,9289469,2013-12-18,10542585,Jean,Colin and Cheung were very pleasant hosts and made me feel at home. They offered good advice and information as to where to go and what to visit; and their place is a walking distance  to the beach. I would recommand their place to everyone.
16760,10067740,2014-01-28,11019237,Scott,"This was our first time ever staying at a BNB and I highly recommend it. Colin and Chung were very helpful, accommodating and respectful. Colin gave us a ride to and from the airport (for a nominal extra fee) and Chung was a great conversationist. We had our own room and bathroom along with wifi. We came and went as we pleased. This is a perfect location for walking or catching the tram or train.  You won't be disappointed with this stay. "
16760,10791947,2014-03-08,9823840,Maria,"Our stay at Colins home was most enjoyable. He himself is a very helpful ,kind and considerate man.  Well worth the money.

16760,12155212,2014-04-24,13245415,Jennie,Clement House is exactly what it said it would be. We loved staying here. Colin and Chung were friendly and helpful. Recommended :)
16760,19826663,2014-09-19,4650578,Andreas,"Usually my first night away from home is one of restless sleep. Not so for me at Clement House. I immediately felt comfortable and ""at home"" there. Lovely room, comfortable bed in a wonderful old house. Close to the transport I needed. And two very welcoming hosts. Thanks Chung and Colin for a delightful stay. I would certainly recommend others to stay with you."
16760,20966871,2014-10-08,18737608,Yvonne,"I really enjoyed my stay in Melbourne! Colin und Chung were two lovely and pleasant hosts. They are both very communicativ, but if you don´t like to talk, it is ok too. I liked my stay with them very much. I felt like home away from home. Colin was so friendly to pick me up from the bus station late at night and to transfer to the airport early in the morning (for a small reasonable fee). I had some good conversations with Chung. Colin has given a lot of information which can best do in and around Melbourne and how to get there. 
The room is very large with a private bathroom. The room faces the street and has a balcony, but one doesn´t hear something from the street. My sleep there was very well. The bed was very comfortable and everything neat and clean. The neighborhood in St. Kilda is nice too, it´s only about 15 minutes away from the beach. Supermarkets, laundry rooms and restaurants are also nearby. And it takes only a few minutes to walk to the tram to the central city which needs about an half hour.
I can highly recommend this accomodation to all who are looking for a quiet place to stay with nice, communicative and tidy Hosts and not far away from the inner city. Thank you! "
16760,21326875,2014-10-14,21820546,Sharon,Chung welcomed me when I arrived at the guest house a lovley chatty guy.   The room was as expected just as described and the bed comfy and a fresh towel.
16760,22855213,2014-11-16,19556671,Paul,Very well located and quiet.  Colin is a great host and Harriet enjoyed her stay.
16760,23484753,2014-12-01,3274,Kristen,"Check-in to Colin's home was seamless, and he and Chomg were very pleasant during my stay. The house is large, clean and quiet, and I slept very well. It is close to many shops, restaurants, a gas station and grocery store. The beach is about a 20 minute walk away or 10 minute run. Chomg was very helpful with advice for stuff to do around the city. "
16760,24810623,2015-01-03,18634865,John,"The accommodation was as described, comfortable bed and private bathroom and lounge room. Shared kitchen.
Access to transport was fantastic, close to train (500m) and tram (200m), no need for a hire car unless you intend to take trips to Yarra Valley or Mornington Peninsular. It was less than a 10min train trip to central Melbourne.
Pubs and Cafes in the area were well priced and of good quality. 
Colin was most helpful with advise on local amenities and travel.
Would recommend.
"
16760,25685769,2015-01-23,25021040,Susanne,"The room is very clean and bright! It was a pleasure to stay with Colin, he picked me up from the airport and drove me through the city to show it to me. Every single time I was washing my plates, they wanted to do it for me! The house is stunning, and very close to everything (I had no car and it was not a problem at all). I can only recommend this place"
16760,27496844,2015-03-06,3384358,Cameron,Colin met us on arrival at the property and explained all the facilities available. He was friendly and welcoming and willing to help with anything we needed. Very pleasant experience. Room was clean and tidy and we had access to a kitchen and courtyard which was helpful. 
16760,27624561,2015-03-08,7560891,Nele,"Colin was really welcoming and friendly, very easy to contact and the room was gorgeous and clean. I loved the high ceilings and the view over the balcony. The neighboorhood is cool with lots of nice little café's and bars. Would definitely stay here again."

16760,29460431,2015-04-07,341171,Marty & Evelyn,"Colin and Jung were gracious hosts and the accommodations are in an ideal location in the heart of St. Kilda. Chapel Street is close by as is Balaclava station and St. Kilda street, so there are many transit options  to get into the city.
The neighbourhood has lots of great eateries and cafes nearby, and there is no shortage of activities and shopping.
Our room was large and we had exclusive use of the bathroom as there was no one else staying at the home.
However, there was very poor WiFi reception in the actual room and this made booking online tours etc. troublesome. To his credit, Colin did offer us freedom to use the WiFi on the main floor where the signal was stronger.
Colin invited us to use the main kitchen which we greatly appreciated. Both he and Jung were very friendly, and it was a pleasure getting to know them both."
16760,30332076,2015-04-20,13983356,Christian,"Colin and Chung made us very welcome. Colin picked us up from the airport for $50 which was way more convenient and about the same price as getting public transport. The breakfasts they supplied were excellent. The house is lovely, a big Victorian place with very high ceilings and a sense of space. Transport to the city is easy and there are eating places nearby. 
I would certainly recommend it!
"
16760,49538366,2015-10-04,12604692,Carl,Colin was an excellent host. For a small fee he picked me up from the airport and drove me back to the space. The bedroom was large and comfortable. I felt very at home during my stay. Highly recommend!
16760,53449277,2015-11-09,16266709,Paula,"What a great place!
The location was excellent as it's incredibly close to trains, trams and within walking distance to the beach. The beautiful Victorian house was spotlessly clean throughout and the hosts Colin and Chung were really welcoming.  What more could you ask for?
Thank you again for making the stay in Melbourne such a lovely experience."
16760,55999816,2015-12-07,50338898,James,"I booked Colin's place for my Parents as they were over from Nz to visit their new Grand daughter. The place was perfect for them to stay as they were out and about all day. Colin was great and very welcoming, I highly recommend Colin's place if you are looking for something in St Kilda.

 "
16760,57092738,2015-12-21,18933845,Justin,"I had a wonderful stay with Colin and would high recommend this accommodation.

The room was large and very comfortable  and in a great location to get to either the beach at St Kilda or the shops and cafes of Chapel street.

Located near the station it was also only 10 minutes to the city.

"
16760,57930407,2015-12-30,1187870,Seth,"Having lived in Melbourne for 8 years , Colin's home was the sort that I  always wished that I  could  live in. A 2 storey Victorian with all the period details, this is the perfect  place to stay. 2 blocks from 2 supermarkets and  the Carlisle St shops. The Balaclava Station is 2 further blocks away  on Carlisle--handy for taking SkyBus from the airport and the train from Southern Cross (City Loop to Flinders St;Sandringham line 5 stops to Balaclava). Chapel Street  tram for trendy Toorak Road is 2 blocks away.  ST. Kilda tram for the city museums and sites is 5 blocks away. 
I stayed in a light, airy upstairs room with an adjacent private bath. No AC,  but fan available. Elegant brekkie is available for less than a flat white and a roll out in town. 
Colin could not have been more welcoming or informative. 
This is the perfect base for a Melbourne stay."
16760,65401217,2016-03-13,17819985,Simon,Colin was very nice and helpful! I had a great stay and would recommend to anyone who is interested in visiting St Kilda. 
16760,69306598,2016-04-10,64004358,Helene,Colin och hans partner var mycket gästvänliga och tillmötesgående. De ansträngde sig för att man skulle känna sig välkommen och trivas. Rent och snyggt i en trivsam miljö. Jag rekommenderar verkligen Colin som värd! 
16760,78980912,2016-06-10,3384358,Cameron,Host was great. We have stayed here before and would be happy to do so again. Close to all amenities and public transport. Good value and ideal for Melbourne city trips.

Both he and his partner were pleasant and respectful of our privacy. They suggested restaurants and also washed our dishes for us.

Wifi was weak and unusable most of the time. There is a library nearby with free wifi. Great location with lots of good food and cafes."

16760,198888825,2017-10-01,8803160,Dzenana,"Our stay at Colin's place was great! His place is well located in St Kilda, close to trams that can take you direct to the city and other spots in Melbourne. The suburbs of St Kilda itself is an amazing place to stay, very close to bustling Chapel Street if you want to do shopping or a short walk to the beach if you want to enjoy the ocean! The bed and amenities were as described and internet was good also. Colin was very flexible with check in which was great as you didn't feel rushed to get there at a certain time! We highly recommend Colin's place for your stay in Melbourne!"

16760,218971295,2017-12-16,69690079,Konnor,"Colin and his housemaster Chung were excellent and friendly hosts - They always sought to make me feel taken care of and welcomed. 

The stay was superb value for money, with all amenities working properly except the wifi connectivity; The range of the network was blocked by the old thick walls, so there isn't any connection from the bedroom. This was of particular issue to me, since I work from my computer full time, but those who seek a vacation to disconnect could be perfectly alright with this.

Water pressure was good, plenty of space to sit and relax with a book, and the spacious bedroom would be ideal for couples. Location was right next to a supermarket and to Carlisle street, so lots of options for food. 

Chung regularly cleaned my room from top to bottom once a week; he keeps a spotless house. 

All around a great experience, just with a very inconvenient issue for me specifically due to my telecommuting job, and the poor wifi signal from the bedroom."
16760,241361449,2018-03-08,5167671,John,"I had a great stay at Colin's house. His place is conveniently located near public transport, the beach, and great cafes and shops. Its only 5 stops on the overground train to the city center from his place. He coordinated a ride to and from the airport and provided me with many good recommendations for Melbourne and the surrounding area. Would definitely stay here again!"

38271,144038,2010-11-24,264086,Ryan,Darly and Dee were very very friendly and nice. They gave us many informations about the great place. I love Great Ocean Road. The house is amazing. We loved the private place. because we don't want to distrub anybody. Because we went out in afternoon and got back at midnight. We had a great time and thanks for letting us stay in your home.
38271,151263,2010-12-09,285201,Ishmeet,"For anyone seeking a comfortable and family like home away from home Daryl and Dee are the people to look up to. I do not have enough words to thank or appreciate their efforts in making our stay with them memorable. They have made a permanent place in our hearts. Soon enough the excellent facilities available at the property were secondary to the hospitality and warmth shown by the Hargreaves family including their 3 lovely daughters. For people like me who are new to Melbourne, there can never be a better picture of a perfect Australian family..Jesus be with them always and thumbs up to their property..we will miss the fun we had here.....Just dont have to worry about anything @ Daryls' place!!!!!....well located in a beautiful surrounding and close to everything...you are in an upmarket country side lifestyle with everything chic and modern around.............cheers.

38271,197333,2011-03-12,385345,Karmini,"Airbnb thank you most sincerely 
for recomending such a wonderful and amazing host family to enjoy our stay in 
Australia. We went to Australia with so much of negative ideas and doubts, but 
these two truly amazing people were more than hosts to us.  They were our 
friends and family.  Deanna took it upon herself to help our son to find his way 
to Moorabin airport almost daily to complete his multi enigine flight training.  
In fact we went out for dinner with friends, while Deanna picked up Shehan from 
the station.  We also had a set of documents nicely compiled by her, of things 
to do and places to visit.  In fact they both took us to see houses being 
designed and constructed which is our forte.  Thank you Daryl and Deanna and 
your three wonderful kids and our little adorable four legged Charlee, for a 
truly amazing and an awesome holiday.  We will definitely come back to Australia 
for a complete holiday without flight training and studies next time and spend 
more time with you.  Hope you will have it ready for us once again. 

Cheers and God Bless all of you!

Karmini, Roshan and Shehan"
38271,300571,2011-06-06,606076,Jenny,"Daryl and Deana were awesome! They have a lovely house and the room was nice, warm and cozy. Deanna was always around to have a nice chat with... although I have been quiet as a mouse upstairs! They have lovely girls and enjoyed their company during the weekends too! I definitely recommend staying in their lovely home."
38271,419925,2011-08-04,848220,Steven,"We stayed with Daryl and Deanna for one night in August and could not fault our stay. The family were friendly and welcoming. The apartment was comfortable, spacious and private with a kitchen that was thoughtfully stocked for a light and healthy breakfast. 

We felt like we were an extended part of the family for the day! Daryl picked us up from the train station and Deanna dedicated her morning to helping us pick up our transport and making sure we were on our way safely! 

We would wholeheartedly recommend staying with them."
38271,629550,2011-10-15,539931,Sarah,"My partner and I have come to Australia on a long term basis, and wanted a good solid start base to begin our emigration. Before we even arrived in Australia, Deanna and Daryl were so helpful in giving us information about where to get hire cars, possible rental homes, things we may need to make our transition easier. We didn't know the couple before this trip, but they felt like long lost friends before our plane even landed. They weren't just giving us a room, they have been like a second family to us. Also, their apartment was so clean and fresh, it has just been totally renovated so felt like we were in a hotel. Deanna and Daryl made us feel so welcome, even down to the little touches like putting cadburys chocolate on our beds for our arrival, and stocking us up with the basics in the fridge to help us start out. Their place is quite far from the city, but that is the only down side (and a minor one at that), but not a problem if you hire a car, which we found better as we got to see more of Melbourne that way, plus we could drive to a nearby park that had wild kangaroos!!!!!!!! You don't get that in the city! So if you want to stop somewhere warm, friendly and inviting then this is the place to choose. You will never feel on your own, and if you ever need to know anything, Deanna will blow your mind with information. She's fantastic and we can't thank her and Daryl enough for giving us the best start to our journey!!!!!! Thank you both :o)"
38271,851025,2012-01-09,717003,Brian,"Amazing accommodations, and the hosts couldn't have been more friendly and helpful! Provided a full fridge for a hearty breakfast, fast internet service, privacy in our own suite upstairs, flat screen TV, comfortable beds, and our own pet dog, Charlie:) Lots of maps, brochures, etc., and recommendations re what to see. 
We thought it might be a tad too far from the city when we arrived, but soon learned that it was an ideal location....a shorter drive to Phillip Island to see the Little Penguins, and close to the train station for the ride into town. Lots of services in walking distance, and a nice, quiet upscale neighborhood.
Rate it a 6 star!!"
38271,1316484,2012-05-21,2104518,Russell,"Lovely hosts. Even better apartment. Great location for us and a clean and relaxing stay. We hope to come back soon and spend a bit more time getting to know Daryl, Dee and family."
38271,2261564,2012-09-11,1695787,Debi,"Wonderful ... we were thrilled to find a listing very close to our daughter in Melbourne so decided to try for an upcoming weekend visit - our first Airbnb experience !!!
Wow - the apartment was even better than the photos - fully self contained with a separate entrance - the entire apartment was spotless - beautifully comfortable bedrooms (great bed) 
- linen, towels all best quality and lots of towels
- fully equipped kitchen and a fridge full - large juice, 2 types milk, 2 types bread, fresh yoghurt, etc., selection of jams, teas and so on !
There was even a cask of wine !!
Did I mention the full size swimming pool and BBQ ? 
Our thanks to our hosts, Daryl and Dianna who were very friendly and look forward to getting to know them a bit better next time we stay ! "
38271,3009146,2012-12-02,4152787,Sandra,"Relocating to Australia from South Africa, we needed a place to stay in Berwick before moving into ou long term rental accommodation ...  and we couldn't have asked for a better place than with Daryl and Deanna! The apartment was spacious, clean, very well equipped and stocked with everything that we needed during our 8 night stay.  Daryl and Deanna really made us feel most welcome and at home in what is essentially their backyard and they were so very helpful during our stay and even afterwards. I would really recommend this accommodation to anyone without thinking twice. Thanks Daryl en Deanna for being such lovely hosts !  We really loved staying in the apartment. "
38271,3014329,2012-12-03,2434646,Vanessa,"Daryl and Deanna's house is lovely and the apartment was soooooo fantastic! Very modern with everything you could need, including a well stocked breakfast pantry :-) The place even has a lovey swimming pool, and a very cute jack Russell who likes to play catch in the garden. 
Daryl and Deanna's were very friendly and welcoming. We highly recommend their place to stay at."
38271,3340598,2013-01-13,4377922,Jen,"What a great find!  Daryl and Dee thank you so much for being so welcoming and such delightful hosts.  We wished we didn't have to go so quickly.....we could have chatted for hours I'm sure!  The accommodation exceeded our expectations.  So hope we can get back there one day.  We wish you every beautiful thing in life and pray the Lord continues to bless the work of your hands.  Jen, Graham and Ebony"
38271,3646654,2013-02-27,4650866,Boris,"We stayed at Old Trafford Apartment in Melbourne for 5 days and were very, very happy with our accommodation. The apartment was lovely :(looking even better in real life than on the photos ! ) very clean, spacious and comfortable. Our hosts provided fresh bread, milk and other provisions for breakfast upon our arrival (this was a nice bonus). 
In terms of value for money - the Old Trafford Apartment is fantastic. Instead of paying much more for less spacious accommodation in CBD Melbourne, it seems much more reasonable to rent a car and stay at the lovely Old Trafford.  We would highly recommend it to our friends."
38271,3898754,2013-03-25,5493386,Jo,"Great place to stay.  Very homely, clean and spacious.   Just like staying in a home away from home.      Deanna and Daryl were very helpful in helping us find a rental property and recommending locations to live as we are relocating from NZ to Melbourne in a couple of weeks time.      Deanne also helped us put together applications for rental properties, which we really appreciated.

Would definitely recommend Old Trafford Apartment to friends and family."
38271,4089125,2013-04-08,1737957,David,We enjoyed our stay very much! Daryl and his wife were really warm hosts. The house was beautiful and spacious. We would certainly recommend their place to our friends and look forward to our next stay.

38271,13813011,2014-06-05,12859146,Merrina,"We arrived late at Daryl's place but he was very understanding and extremely nice. He waited for us until 1030pm and greeted us with a wide smile,  brought us around and explained everything to us. They also prepared lots of food in the fridge for us for the next day's breakfast. The house was nicely decorated and clean with everything you will need (towels, toiletries). Missy the cat and Charlie the dog were extremely welcoming and cute. Love the wall map. Definitely a great place to stay and best host ever, highly recommended!"
38271,17499038,2014-08-13,14461854,Tracy,"We were made to feel very welcomed.
The apartment was very well presented and comfortable."
38271,19071228,2014-09-06,6381275,Joyce,"Daryl and his wife are excellent hosts, who gave us suggestions on what to do and also provided down jackets for us when we mentioned about Phillip island. We were not prepared for the freezing weather and I really have to say a big thank you to our awesome hosts! 

Accomodation wise, the house was clean and breakfast well provided for. Heater was available till before we slept but the rooms can get cold during the night. 

Overall, we are pretty satisfied. :)"
38271,20218769,2014-09-25,21627178,Gareth,"Quick response to booking enquiries, and very helpful friendly host. Great property on all counts."

A quiet neighbourhood with welcoming and hospitable hosts who were more than happy to assist us in any way possible. The apartment was immaculate, well equiped and clean and the beds were really comfortable! We will be back. Definitely value for money. "
38271,30292906,2015-04-20,25967818,Rick And Elly,"So easy to recommend a stay at Old Trafford, spoilt for choices when it came to have our breakfast, the area we had was like living at home, extremely clean and roomy. Our host looked after use with the minimum of fuss. "

38271,31994748,2015-05-12,32186605,Robert,"The Good:
Quick replies and communication. My mother and aunty were kindly greeted into the property. The property was extremely tidy and there was bread, milk and other items in the kitchen awaiting. 

The Bad:
I would suggest that Daryl puts further details in his house rules around acceptance of smokers. I booked this property because it had an outdoor balcony and I know my mum  and aunty would want to pop outside for a smoke.  Unfortunately my mum and aunty felt a little uncomfortable doing this, following some questioning from the hosts. I booked this place to make my families visit as comfortable as possible and I would have chosen somewhere else if I would have known. 

With that said; The hosts were friendly, the beds were comfy, the house was clean and cosy.  Definitely recommended for non smokers. Great overall value. 

"
38271,33417963,2015-05-27,12854832,Lynden,My booking was last minute and I greatly appreciated the effort Deanna put in to get the apartment ready.  The apartment was warm and cosy and central to everything. Thanks for the lamington!
38271,36804491,2015-07-01,21742846,George,"Daryl's wife was waiting for us as we drove up - how did she do that?

We were immediately made to feel most welcome and shown around the accommodation in great detail.  Everything was clean and modern with an extensive selection if food for breakfast - the fruit loaf was great!

We were made to feel a part of their family."
38271,38111185,2015-07-13,24163910,Judith & Alan,"Delightful space with loads of personality. Clean, comfy, classy - well appointed and loads of extras. Spoilt for choice with teas! Lauren and Dei were warm and welcoming, sharing the story of their space.  Loved the world map with pins marking guest origins - now with ours added. We were free to make ourselves at home without intrusion during our stay. Quiet neighbourhood close to all the access roads for our weekend destinations.  Great fish and chip shop nearby! Walking distance to plenty of shops and every food option you could want. "
38271,40980937,2015-08-03,38217588,Mike,"We would highly recommend Old Trafford to anyone. It was our family's first AirBnB trip and we were extremely impressed with Daryl & Deanna's place, most importantly, the friendliness and open communication. The place was as described in the photos. Very clean, simple and quiet. We rented a car from the airport and it took us about 1 hour to get to Berwick. Staying in Berwick allowed us to easily explore Melbourne without getting stuck in heavy traffic and being limited to a small space. Definitely consider staying here if you come to Melbourne and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the CBD and inner suburbs or if you have a rental car."
38271,47303993,2015-09-17,43457002,Michelle,My first experience with airbnb and it was great.

Wifi works great, air conditioning is available and the beds are super new and confortable. I would definitely recommend this place 100%. It's in a great part of town with shopping areas in walking distance. This will be my first choice next time I visit. Amazing hosts!  Charlie is the best greeter you'll ever meet and the pool and lemon tree just added to the experience. 5 stars!"
38271,53773967,2015-11-12,39557811,Evelyn,Thank you for having us stay at your AirBNB.  We were given great instructions and advice on getting around the area for shopping and to get to our workshop the next morning.  The accommodation was fantastic and we really appreciated the extras such as real coffee and breakfast.  The raisin toast was delicous.  My traveling partner is going to also join AirBnB as she does alot of travel for her work and was really impressed.
38271,54308346,2015-11-18,36156006,Val,"We had a wonderful stay in this home. Our hostess Dee was delightful. She made us feel most welcome and was very helpful in settling us in, and providing us with local knowledge. Staying here to attend the Geocaching Mega was just perfect. Also this whole area is wonderful for both Geocaching and is a veritable Munzee heaven. I was disappointed that we never met Daryl, but Dee looked after us very well"
38271,54620505,2015-11-22,47765746,Darryl,"Our stay at Old Trafford was wonderful. Our hosts Daryl and Deanna we kind and welcoming.

38271,56517824,2015-12-14,44702499,Kathy,"Dee met us on arrival and was very welcoming.  The apartment is great and we felt right at home as soon as we entered.  We didn't need to go out for any supplies as coffee, tea, milk, bread, condiments and cereal were all provided .. such a nice change from motel/hotel accommodation.  I am sure it is one of the better accommodation choices in the area.  "
38271,60117937,2016-01-19,39653071,Michael,"The host made us feel welcome by keeping in touch before hand and having the house clean and well stocked for our arrival.  The neighborhood was quiet, with many eating venues and shops near by, as well as public transport.  "

 The unit was very nice and clean and spacious, nicely decorated..
We loved having little Charlie come greet us every now and then.
We like that it was away from noisy areas, just in a nice peaceful street , and in an area where we wanted to be, it was great to have WIFI on too, so I could finally get in touch with our family.
I would recommend this place very highly.
  Thank you Daryl and Deanna, and cutie  Charlie.
We will most certainly stay there again."

It was wet and we were warned about the outside stairs but Dee said they were going to get anti slip pads installed very soon. Everything was clean and very comfortable. 
The listing description was very accurate, it was modern and fresh - no tired furniture or equipment.
It was a nice residential quiet neighbourhood and easy to find.  The location was very suitable for us in attending an event in Berwick."
38271,90425587,2016-08-01,45135901,Shamal,I needed a place for my parents to stay for 1 night. Daryl was very welcoming and hospitable.  It was the first time my parents tried airbnb and they had the most relaxing time!

It was exactly what we were after. Clean, modern, with beautiful decor and amenities.

Our host, Dee, is absolutely gorgeous and made us feel so welcome. 

We also loved the very central location of the apartment: near a lot of restaurants, not too far out of Berwick and close to the freeways. 

Totally recommend this apartment to anyone. It's just fabulous. 

Thank you for a positive stay, Dee and Daryl. "
38271,104283845,2016-09-26,35451613,Jennifer,Dee & Daryl were great hosts! The place was tidy & comfortable. They were nice enough to supply tea & toast in the morning which is great and convenient when you are only have the one night stay. Thank you for having us! Would 100% stay again!

38271,121921388,2016-12-19,71086234,Abhilash,A good place for families to stay . Loved the pin board where we can pin down the place we come from . Individual bedrooms with comfortable beds is one of the biggest boon.  Lack of an induction stove is a slight setback. Extremely friendly host with an amazing house makes this place a lovely place to stay with family .

The hosts are close by so they can easily help with any questions or advice, which is fabulous if you're not too familiar with the area - your own personal concierge :) The apartment was well appointed with modern furnishings, large spacious bathroom, equipped kitchen and extremely clean throughout. I would like to underline that comment - the entire apartment was so impressively clean you can see that they take a lot of care with this property and as a result have a really lovely place for a holiday.

Di was very welcoming when we arrived and I'm sure she rushed back from the shops as we arrived a little earlier than anticipated.  The accommodation was spotlessly clean.

The unit was exactly as described, located upstairs attached to the main residence with very little sound transmission between the areas. 
Also the fridge stocked with a nice breakfast spread was a much appreciated surprise.

Nice and close to shopping centre and train station although we would recommend worth the drive through to Belgrave, or even Upper Ferntree Gully stations if you are wanting to get the train through to Melbourne City as this has a more frequent train timetable.

Home was clean and tidy and Dee/Darryl were very welcoming with extra touches of provisions for kitchen on our arrival and a pleasant living arrangement with 3 bedrooms available for our stay."

I'm really thanks for Diana
We spent great time at her house and in Melbourne
 

"
41836,270435,2011-05-19,441243,Ls,"Diana's home is just 30 mins drive from the city. And very short distance from the airport. Her housemate is very friendly. Someday offer his cooking food with us. The room is spacious especially the wardrobe, if you plan a long holiday, you may find the wardrobe to be very useful. If you wish to cook, the kitchen utensil is there to use. "
41836,406994,2011-07-30,815151,Amal,"i loved the stay at Dianas place, it felt like home, the housemate was really friendly and was always there if i needed help, if am coming back to melbourne again i would love to stay with Dianas place again"
41836,519887,2011-09-11,529069,Pablo,"Diana is a very good hostess, very worried about all the details, even before you get to her home.

The room was quite nice and big enough, and the location of the house is OK, but if you can get a bike, your stay will really much better. 

The closer train station is arround 1 Km far away from the home, and the supermarket is just two stops from the train station that is closest to the house. 

The house is just 15Km far away from the city centre, and you has to consider that Melbourne is huge, because almost all the Aussies live in houses instead of big buildings, so If you are going to visit melbourne for just a couple of days, consider that you are going to spend some time traveling from one side to other every day.

Many thanks Diana, we really enjoy our staying in your home during the last month"
41836,547411,2011-09-19,1121742,Kumar,"If you want a host who is not only super friendly but a genuine person who cares about you then it is Diana.  Diana is more concerned about your welfare and your personal comfort than in just leasing her place for the sake of leasing.

I recommend Diana unreservedly and I can guarantee you will not feel shortchanged at any time.

41836,973157,2012-03-05,38565,Miguel,If you want a good location and a feeling of being at home this is the place.  We shared the house with Diana's parents and they were adorable.  We got home made dumplings and her mum was nice enough to offer us breakfast every morning.  If you want a soft bed make sure you ask for it in your reservation since  Diana and her parents like to sleep on really firm beds. We got the soft mattress during our stay. Overall we had a wonderful stay and look forward to staying there again.

The place was tidy, warm and convenient from traffics. Diana kindly provided us information about public traffics, nice places for dining and touring guid before we got to Melbourne.

41836,3099112,2012-12-16,3373756,Peter,"Diana was very welcoming and friendly during our two night stay with her. We booked this area as it was close to Melbourne airport (15 minutes) and easy access to Melbourne city. We shared a bathroom with Diana and had access to her kitchen and lounge. Our double bed was firm and comfortable. For those that might be expecting added extras, just to let you know there were no towels available and we took our own breakfast. For the price paid, this simple home covered our needs. Diana was very good and quick to respond to any communication with her. "
41836,3150230,2012-12-24,4423581,Annette,"Accommodation was neat and comfortable.  Diana was very friendly and helpful.  Gave me gems of advice re places to go (and eat!) that only a local would know.  Diana even gave me a lift to the train station (and saved me a 10-min walk) my first morning.  This is exactly why I chose to stay in a bnb.  Thanks, Diana!"

Instantly we felt welcome and at home :) From explaining directions and transport to showing us around famous streets we had most definitely enjoyed our stay. We will miss their company and kindness. Diana is very friendly and caring, and Rob also has a great sense of humour (as well as being very talented at singing and playing guitar!)

好吧,还是说回房子｡Diana和Rob是那种让人感觉很peace的人,房间也给人这样的感觉,舒适的床和沙发,不是特别井井有条,但就是家的感觉｡
Diana会做好吃的菜,Rob会自弹自唱70年代老歌(非常有魅力),让人感觉很舒服｡"

The next day we all went out to a shopping centre together and the next morning they drove us into the city. We could not of asked for more welcoming hosts, very friendly and helpful - would defiantly recommend to anyone wishing to stay in the area.  "

The house is in a very cute residential neighbourhood just outside of Melbourne, and was only a 10 minute walk from the nearest train station.

43429,148912,2010-12-05,231113,Georgette,"Our 3 week stay at our unit in Oakleigh East proved to be much more comfortable and much better than we expected.
The host Allan Gibb welcomed us warmly and was always around when needed, but was very discreet at all times.
The accommodation was very comfortable and big enough to house two persons with ease, a comfortable double bed , and a kitchen good enough for mny meals to be savoured, we had full use of the outer verandah, for barbeques.
and of course the herb garden!! we had thyme, mint, lemons, garlic and green onions..
Overall 
Very good for long stays and short stays , very safe environment, good for walking in the mornings and evenings, has a convenience store a few steps down the road and a hairdresser.
a bus a walk down the road takes you to chdstone shopping centre and oakleigh.
I would definitely recommend a friend and be a repeat customer"
43429,159105,2010-12-27,51534,Alicia,"Allan was great! His apartment (which we stayed an extra 3 nights it was so great) was clean, modern, and had everything we needed. Allan himself is wonderful and extremely helpful. He invited us over for Chirstmas Day lunch with his family and him and my boyfriend chatted for hours. I would recommend his apartment to everyone.

Alicia"
43429,182567,2011-02-15,323895,Kirsten,"My partner and I stayed in Allan's studio apartment for 3 weeks when we relocated to Melbourne from New Zealand. The apartment itself has everything you need for a cost effective stay - from kitchen bits and bobs to a washing machine - and is very modern and tidy. Allan is very friendly and accommodating - I would highly recommend staying at his place, if you are looking for a place out of the city which is peaceful and definately tranquil."
43429,184848,2011-02-20,339211,Bill,"My wife and I had a most enjoyable time in Allan's flat. Good bed, very clean and good facilities. Allan was a good host: very friendly and supportive, but non-intrusive. I would highly recommend this property, and we would definitely stay there agin."
43429,193105,2011-03-06,390988,Sarah,A very unique 'home away from home'
43429,196151,2011-03-10,367859,Mackayla,"my stay at Allen's home was wonderful, very warm and cosy both in Allan's kindness and the surounds of the space. The garden was so sweet, the bed was comfy and the space was spotlessly clean, much appreciated. loved it."
43429,214820,2011-04-01,463742,Rooth,"Allan's a top bloke and his place is really, really special. It's the kind of place that makes you want to hole up and stay in and not go out into Melbourne at all! Relaxing, peaceful, yet with an IGA express on the corner and a bus route into town; a tranquil garden and little travel treasures about the place, I'd love to return. Many thanks, lovely place. Rooth and Russell. "
43429,246587,2011-05-01,438641,Solveig,"When relocating from Sweden, we stayed almost 1 month at Allan’s place. The apartment is very cozy, clean and well maintained and includes everything you need even for longer time. Allan is a wonderful host, very helpful and generous and also a great information source for us “first-timers” in Australia. We really would like to give the apartment (and Allan) our warmest recommendations.
/ Håkan, Solveig and Linn"
43429,257113,2011-05-09,528682,Michael,"Quality - that is the word that first comes to mind to describe not only Allans place but also the thought he has put into hosting. Allans place is very clean, very brightly lit and the layout well planned. Large flatscreen tele, new and matching crockery, new fridge - I felt like I was staying in a brand new place which points to the level of care and maintenance Allan puts into his place. My visitors, two different sets and locals were impressed by the place too. Will not hesitate recommending a stay at Allans. "
43429,267745,2011-05-17,490884,Chris,"Allan's accommodation is first rate, which was perfect for our long-weekend escape away from the kids!

It contains all of the mod-cons you'd need for either a short break or a longer stay and everything was in a very clean and excellent condition.  Highly recommended."
43429,288438,2011-05-30,569419,Greg,"I enjoyed my stay at Tranquillity very much.  Alan is very helpful and very knowledgeable about the area.  The house is located in a quiet suburb and is near new with amenities to suite anyone.  The location is great for getting around to all parts of Melbourne very easily.  If you are looking for a quiet spot to relax or a place to come home to after work, you will find it here."
43429,313968,2011-06-14,559362,Ralph,"This was a great place to stay as it was so close to the Clayton Campus of Monash. Very well located between 2 main roads so easy access by car everywhere including Chadstone shopping! The room was perfect - very new and so clean and warm and cosy. It had everything we needed, even a hair dryer.  The bed was comfy and there was even a bowl of fresh fruit. Allan was a great host and left us alone when we needed but was also a great help during the chaos caused by the volcanic ash.

We will certainly stay again. The garden was beautiful."
43429,389102,2011-07-22,772078,Khie Kian,"We were very pleased with the bright and cheery apartment which was very clean and functional. Its location in a quiet and peaceful neighbourhood near the Clayton Campus of Monash University served our needs perfectly. Host Allan and his wife, Liz, were warm and friendly and they made us feel welcome and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our 10-day stayand were most reluctant to leave. We certainly look forward to staying there again when the opportunity arises."
43429,574578,2011-09-27,1034895,Larry,"Very nice complete apartment with useful kitchen and bathroom. Newly built and everything is provided - some breakfast, shampoo, and even detergent for the washing machine. Only instant coffee however, and no iron and ironing board. The host is helpful and the setting is in a beautiful garden."
43429,600420,2011-10-05,312714,Rohini,"I couldn't have picked a better place to stay. My mom was in town, all the way from India and she absolutely loved our little home. Thanks Alan for the yummy chocolates, fruit and the gorgeous room!"
43429,620743,2011-10-11,1223261,Raj,Place is preety good with all basic amenities (except iron and board and Internet). Internet was not provided so it was bit difficult for me as I am new in Australia. House Construction work is going just next door so was not able to sleep after 7 in morning. All in all it was ok for me. 
43429,626920,2011-10-13,1265433,Katherine,"Tranquillity in Melbourne was a very lovely comfortable hide away, it was just what i needed :) 
The room had everything i needed, with a light breakfeast and chocolates were a nice touch.
 Also Allan was nice enough to say i could use the clothes dryer when needed.
the Garden is very cute and peaceful.
great place for a quiet get away.
would have loved to stay longer
i would recommend Allens place to all my friends and family 
katherine xxxx"
43429,639417,2011-10-17,743632,David,"Wow, what a lovely little place Allen has got. We were over the moon when we saw it. Especially the touches with the breakfast and the chocolates. The little thoughts left a big impression. 

Allen was very welcoming, easy to talk to, and made us feel at home. Allen's description of Tranquility in Melbourne is no lie, it's exactly how it felt. 

We wish him all the best and hope to stay in touch."
43429,695167,2011-11-06,1145799,Mick,This studio is lovely and suited our need perfectly.  Allan looked after us and was the perfect host.  Highly recommend you stay here if you are looking in this area.  Ros and Mick Argent
43429,716772,2011-11-14,1206221,Tom,"We stayed a week, but wanted to stay longer. Allan is a pleasant host, and the unit is very comfortable and well appointed. It is also quite well located - close to major shopping centres and even a gym just a block away. Will definitely return on my next stay in Melbourne.  "
43429,736882,2011-11-22,812552,Margaret,"Allen's accommodation was very well set up for our week's stay in Melbourne.  The providing of fruit, chocolates, light breakfast and a frozen meal was most welcome.  The quiet garden was a pleasant  addition.  Allen was very helpful with any of our queries about travel within the city and interesting places to visit.  We would recommend Tranquillity as a base for your Melbourne visit.   If using public transport, purchase a zone 1 & 2 ticket to cover the bus trip to Oakleigh Station."
43429,742648,2011-11-25,927121,Jean-Pierre,"We staid 2 nights  at the end of November at Allan's. The studio was perfectly presented, clean and welcoming. Allan's left us with breakfast and chocolates and drinks... in the fridge so we had everything we needed. There is nothing much to stay but a fantastic place to stay. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a short or long term stay in the suburb of Melbourne. Thanks Allan for everything."
43429,799308,2011-12-22,1239459,Melinda,"Well-appointed, modern bungalow sharing common enclosed deck  with main house. As quiet and secluded as can be reasonably expected in suburban Melbourne. Very affable and helpful host. "
43429,898074,2012-02-02,451581,Dmitry,"Many thanks to Alan and Liz for sharing their ideallic homette with us. The appartment was lovely but more importantly, Liz and Allen were always offering and willing to help anyway they could. The little touches like a fruit bowl and the condiments were much appreciated!

Many thanks,
Alex+Gali "
43429,951202,2012-02-27,1103764,Roland,"A complete and nice apartment with everythings you need. Better than staying in a five star hotel. Easy to nearby shopping mall, Monash Uni, etc. Thanks Allan "
43429,1039069,2012-03-25,1398749,Paul,This is a well-equipped studio in a quiet residential neighborhood and within walking distance to Monash University.  Allan was very attentive to any needs I had and I would stay there again without question.  
43429,1127745,2012-04-14,1254794,Sarah,Great value for money and Allan is very friendly and welcoming. Would love to come and stay again when I am in Melbourne.
43429,1421491,2012-06-05,2226786,Marc,"I was here to prepare for a new life in Aus, as the advance party for my family, and this spot was perfect and the hosts were great. "
43429,1602797,2012-07-01,2416839,Tina,"Allan was an amazing host , nothing was to much trouble for him,  and they were very hospitable. All our needs were meet 100%. Cant wait to stay again was over all fantastic ."
43429,1715221,2012-07-15,1632276,Anna,"Wonderful place to stay with great hosts! The studio is set up meticulously – all you would need, plus provision for light breakfast and welcoming chocolates :) Warm, quiet and so cosy.. It is only 6 minutes drive to Chadstone SC and Hoyts cinemas! Thank you very much for having us! "
43429,2047688,2012-08-20,3232016,Lori,Lovely place to stay. Alan and Liz were most accommodating especially as it was such short notice. The apartment had everything that we needed and then some. An easy ride into the city and only a couple of km to chadstone for shopping. We will definetly stay here again. Thank you for sharing with us.
43429,2390301,2012-09-24,2946375,Michelle,"This is an amazing place to stay! To start Allan and Liz are amazing hosts, who only want you to have the best possible stay with them. The house property is beautiful and extremely well kept. The garden and decking next to apartment is beautiful and amazing to look at each day from the window. We were often asked to use any herbs in the garden and to make it our own. Just outside the front undercover door is more decking, but a BBQ that again we were encouraged  to use. The completely detached apartment is accessed by a gated side entrance and the apartment itself is very insulated. We never heard anything from the house and they never heard anything from us. The apartment itself was amazing and even better then the pictures show. Not only does it have everything you need, it has been designed and constructed in such a way that the space works fantastically and everything is used efficiently. The apartment had a full kitchen with oven, hotplates, microwave, kettle, toaster and fridge. It looks small on the photos, but again, it is so well done in where everything is situated that it feels like a full sized kitchen. The shower is lovely and big with a great shower head. I could of lost alot of time in the shower. Next to that is a washing machine, which we did use and was very happy it was there. Again the bathroom area looks small, but the way the space is used, makes it feel larger. The bedroom overlooking the rest of the apartment is large, but as it is all open, really opens everything up. The cupboard space was huge and great to hide our suitcases in and hang up anything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and big enough for both of us.  The living room area has a lovely large flat screen tv and very comfortable leather chairs. We easily sat here all night watching the tv. There is also a desk and chair that we used as a computer desk with some magazines and tourist information. Along with the desk, there is also a bookcase full of books! Always great to be able to grab and book to borrow while relaxing. The entire apartment is heated/cooled by one spilt system unit, but it does an amazing job. It heated the entire place in only a couple of minutes and we never had to have it on long. Overall, my husband and I were ready to move into this apartment. We felt completely at home and was relaxed in moments. It is bright and fresh and extremely well kept and clean. We were brought clean sheets, towels and tea towels often. There is public transport so close and we even walked to Chadstone. When we are next in Melbourne, this is the 1st place we will look for to stay, as it was very hard to leave. Thank you again Allan and Liz! "
43429,2529702,2012-10-07,3354992,Kath,Loved this cosy tranquil studio accommodation. It was just perfect for our 3 day stay in suburban Melbourne. Our hosts were most hospitable and any request was never any trouble. Easy public transport to the city and yet quiet enough to relax and enjoy the garden.
43429,2598867,2012-10-13,3273771,Nick,"These guys are amazing - I agree with all the positive reviews that they have already received. Not only is the accommodation fantastic, but the hosts are wonderful. I have no hesitation in giving them 5 stars and would recommend them to anyone else looking for somewhere to stay in the area."
43429,2805495,2012-11-05,2559217,Kathy,Very clean private place. Bus transportation to downtown was excellent.Really enjoyed our stay.
43429,2888998,2012-11-15,1321635,Angela,"Allans studio isbeautifullly set up and he is a delightful host, adding a welcome package that made us feel very welcome and well taken care of. We also had a car and there was good safe parking on the street. We needed a place with access to the city and Dandenong and this was perfect. I would definately recommend hte studio and Allan to anyone looking for a long or shorter stay around Melbourne. "
43429,3085360,2012-12-14,3275140,Steve,"We stayed for 16 nights in December 2012.  The studio apartment was perfect, had everything we needed and more.  It was very quiet, cosy and comfortable.  Our hosts Allan and Liz were excellent.  I  recommend the apartment to anyone wishing to be in a self contained  studio in a peaceful atmosphere.  We certainly will be back to stay.
Steve and Gayle  Dec 2012"
43429,3125924,2012-12-20,3502572,Christian,"We have had an great stay at Allans Studio! We booked for 2 days and we felt so relaxed in the beautiful surrounding of Javanese garden House with a modern styled Studio with everything we needed to feel even better than at home :-). Vielen Dank nochmal, auch für die angenhemen und netten Unterhaltungen. :-) 
Liebe Grüße Melanie und Christian"
43429,3380584,2013-01-21,3284792,Shirley,"Stayed at Allan and Liz's studio for nine nights, everything was perfect.  The studio had everything we needed except for a full length mirror!!  I'm sure Allan will remedy this.  Very convenient location with the the shops on the corner and quiet at night.  Couldn't have had a better stay.  Highly recommend.
Shirley and David McDonald"
43429,3414627,2013-01-26,3987081,Glenn,I enjoyed my stay. The studio is in very good condition with modern appliances and fittings etc. It's clean and cosy. I was very busy during my stay so didn't use the facilities to cook or enjoy the outdoor area or BBQ but was offered to help myself to the amenities. The hosts Allan and Liz made me feel very welcome. The location is handy to the SE area of Melbourne with Chadstone Mall close by and only a short drive to the SE Freeway. Golf and convenience store/bottle shop at the corner are added benefits:-)
43429,3437984,2013-01-29,2156684,Erin,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay in Allan's studio. It was very clean, stylish and well set up. Allan himself is a lovely host, although we didn't get to see much of him as he was very busy! Very close to the supermarket as well (almost next door) which was convenient. I would definitely recommend this place to others."
43429,3485228,2013-02-05,4870584,Chris,"The apartment is spacious, light and comfortable.  Location is fairly close to major shopping centres and the convenience of the IGA on the corner is excellent.

The Gibbs were friendly and accommodating and even though the unit is in close proximity of the main house privacy was not an issue.

I would use the apartment again and recommend it to people looking for a safe, clean, comfortable studio in Melbourne's Eastern Suburbs."
43429,28514001,2015-03-25,25610117,Russell,"My wife and had a most harmonious stay for almost a month. We recommend this accommodation highly as a fine, quiet and efficient one bedroom suite. 
We hope to stay here  again. Our hosts were quietly delightful and unobtrusive. The air conditioned  unit is small but tasteful and has everything we needed from the nice but small bathroom and kitchen. A fabulous bonus is the huge  outdoor covered deck area with a nice dining table and bbq, plus a pleasant view into a grassed area and small fish pond. Flowers everwhere. A gem of a spot.

43429,28889522,2015-03-31,27453460,Jennifer,"Melbourne's best kept secret, and we are able to share it with you.  What a find!  This was the first time we used AirBnb, and we hit gold with Allan's little hideaway.  Communication with Allan was easy, both prior to our arrival and during our stay.  The little extras that Allan provided were totally unexpected.  eg bread, butter, breakfast cereal, milk, tea, coffee, chocolates, orange juice.  Facilities were exemplary.  Location suited our purposes.  Close to supermarket, takeaway, laundromat, asnd public transport.   
Off street parking provided.    We would highly recommend this little hideaway, and would certainly book here again, if ever in Melbourne. "
43429,29507333,2015-04-08,29014638,Jennifer,Liz and Allan greeted us warmly and were very helpful. The apartment is lovely and in a quiet location. All the little 'extras' were greatly appreciated.
43429,32344152,2015-05-17,7659443,Mohamed,Thank you very much Allan we had a wonderful two weeks stay. Lovely place would recommend to anyone.
43429,32920108,2015-05-23,2766853,Kristie,"This is a terrific place to stay with a fully equipped kitchen and warm, effective heating. Hosts were lovely even providing milk, fruit, jam and bread and other basics to make the first night enjoyable. Great coffee shop and IGA a couple of houses away."
43429,33520968,2015-05-29,4651265,Peter & Dewi,"Cosy, clean, quiet, comfortable little unit in a great location hosted by beautiful people. Allan & Lizzy did all they could to make sure we had a pleasant stay. The unit is very well appointed including a full kitchen. We were greeted with a lovely welcome pack of breakfast food, fruit and chocolates. The view from the kitchen window to a little corner of Java is quite unique. We would definitely return and highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a delightful home away from home."
43429,33744790,2015-05-31,3428326,June,"I would recommend a stay with Allan and Lizzie. The apartment is bright and clean. We were met by Lizzie who came out to meet us. It was a cold evening but the heating was on so it was lovely and warm inside. There was a starter breakfast for the next day. Great coincidence that our hosts came from the same part of England that we did, but unfortunately we didn't have much time to chat. We enjoyed our stay.
"
43429,35657049,2015-06-21,31564821,Eric,"Depiction of room was accurate.  We felt very welcome.  We had full privacy, and the room was ideal.  The location was good in relation to Monash University (25 minute walk, also near bus lines).  Would recommend this room to anyone staying near Monash.  "
43429,35960475,2015-06-23,35119331,Paulina,"Allan and Lizzie were the nicest of hosts and made me feel very welcome. The self contained unit was better than expected and has everything you would ever need. The unit was very private with separate access to the main residence, so if you're after privacy this is the place to go. I was very happy with my stay and would recommend them to anyone. "
43429,36341354,2015-06-27,10857302,Fleur,"My husband and I had a lovely stay at the Javanese Studio for 3 nights.  Cosy accommodation with great heating and small kitchen, living area and bathroom.  Hosts were lovely and left some jam, bread, milk, cereals, juice etc for breakfast which was appreciated.  We utilised the off street car park which was handy for our car and it was also great to have an IGA a few doors down including a cafe and some take away food outlets for convenience.   Location for us was really great too as not far from the freeways.  Highly recommend this accommodation but thought it was worth mentioning that the bed, although comfortable, was quite small (double) so if you are big people like us who are used to Queen/King size bed might be a challenge! Overall we thought this accommodation was great value for money in a handy location if you need to be in the SE suburbs of Melbourne."
43429,37035646,2015-07-04,17201743,Barbara,"Allan and Lizzie are warm and friendly hosts; they went the extra mile to make my stay 'ace'.  The studio itself is a gem: warm, bright, top-notch design.  Plus, the garden view is delightful!  Handy to bus, grocery and food, though parking space is thoughtfully provided.  Thanks to you both."
43429,37886717,2015-07-11,35093237,Wendy,We were made very welcome  by Allan and our accommodation was warm and cosy. We appreciated the starter pack for breakfast and toiletries. The location was ideal for our needs. 
43429,38618877,2015-07-17,35286817,Shruti,"I had a perfect stay at Allan and Lizzie's place. The accommodation was great and had a good heater which helped in the Melbourne winter :) It was clean, well equipped and of a good size for one person. I was attending a course in Melbourne and it was ideal for getting some quiet study done in the evenings and to relax.

Both Allan and Lizzie were very friendly and made me feel welcome, relaxed and comfortable. Definitely recommend staying here. "

Allan and Lizzy are considerate hosts without being intrusive.  The deck is fantastic for entertaining or chilling out with a morning coffee and the garden is peaceful and beautiful. I had a fantastic stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay again or to recommend to friends."

43429,59030539,2016-01-06,21240494,Jean Charles (JC),"We had a great time at Allan and Lizzie's place. The kitchen, the barbecue and the large covered terrace with seating for 6 to 8 allowed us to entertain our children during our stay.
The location close to the Chadstone mall is great as long as you have a car. There is a convenient IGA store and bottle shop 300 meter down the road.
Thank you both for being good hosts and making sure the apartment was in mint condition."

43429,59822021,2016-01-16,14187362,Michelle,"Lizzie and Allen made us feel very welcome upon our arrival, greeting us warmly and showing us around the studio and decking area. They encouraged us if there was anything we needed by calling or notify them to help us enjoy our stay fully. The studio was cosy and had all the amenities we needed to enjoy our stay, including a BBQ, fully equip kitchen, and outdoor dining area. Lizzie kindly provided us with equipment and utensils from her own home. Would definitely recommend this place to others and would really love to stay here again if the opportunity does arise. Thank you Lizzie & Allen for all your kindness and hospitality, many thanks and take care always.

They were warm and friendly but gave as much privacy as was wanted. The accommodation was described very accurately and was absolutely delightful! The neighbourhood was in a perfect location for our needs and was very peaceful. "

Shopping was easy as the apartments location to Chadstone shopping center and the Glen made it ideal. Our host was obliging and met all our requests with prompt attention. The apartment was spotless and comfortable.  We would definitely stay there again.
43429,63170676,2016-02-21,51765690,Alexander,"Great stay in Oakleigh! We loved the clean, tidy and and modern room. Very convenient to Monash Uni. We also really loved the tomatoes and figs from the garden, delicious!!!"
43429,63787108,2016-02-27,26349005,Friederike,I had a really nice time here. The appartment is nice and clean. Lizzie and Allan are the best hosts you could imagine. I highly recommend this place to everyone.

43429,67427713,2016-03-29,22870188,Faith,"We felt very welcomed and were able to relax for the long weekend :) Allan and Lizzie were very thoughtful and had left us some fruit and bread for our late arrival, it's a lovely place to relax and just enjoy Melbourne!"
43429,68830639,2016-04-07,64698707,Stuart,"Having arrived over an hour early, Allan reassured me all was ok and was kind in his offering of Lentil soup! Thanks Allan! beautiful soup prepared by his effervescent partner Lizzy.

The studio is clean, light and airy, a bowl of fruit and some sweet treats added to our welcoming.

Allan and Lizzy are both warm and gracious, enjoyed stay immensely."
43429,70108379,2016-04-16,1394709,Vita,"I had a great time staying 3 nights in Allan and Lizzy's apartment while visiting my son in Monash Uni this time.  The location was perfect for me for going to both city and Monash Uni.  The apartment was spacious and clean and well equipped.  Allan and Lizzy are very friendly and welcoming. They prepared not only a bowl of fruits and whole set of breakfast(with milk,jam, and bread) but also a finger bowl of ""yummy"" chocolate made by Allan's company! What a treat!! Thanks Allan and Lizzy! I would definitely go back to visit and would recommend it anyone:-)"
43429,72712846,2016-05-04,67306793,Robert,"A peaceful little haven in Oakleigh East. A pleasant and clean studio with everything you need, including essential breakfast requisites for the first morning - even some little chocolate treats. We used the studio as a base for visiting family nearby so didn't spend a lot of time there to enjoy the peaceful garden. There was even an outdoor BBQ area we could have entertained a few guests! Convenient to main road and local shops, cafe etc a few doors away."
43429,72784421,2016-05-04,66835137,Kitty,"Stunning  !! completely given you privacy , clean room , shiny kitchen , very nice welcome Chocolate treats , Lizzy is very to happy tell or offer any helps you need ,  this place is just best place I had stayed so far ! "
43429,74596317,2016-05-16,70862740,Dani,"Lizzie greeted us upon our arrival and was extremely warm and welcoming. The private flat was clean and comfortable and warm. The day of our arrival was a chilly autumn day in Melbourne and Lizzie had turned on the heat earlier in the day to ensure it was warm for us. The location was close to Monash University's Clayton Campus, which was the reason for our trip to Melbourne and very close to bus stops. It is also within a comfortable walking distance from the Huntingdale and Oakleigh train stations to get to and from the CBD (when the buses aren't available). The full kitchen and access to the barbecue allowed us to cook for ourselves and there is an IGA Express just a few doors, saving us time and money on food during our trip. This experience set the bar extremely high of our first Airbnb experience and we will be sure to look in to staying again if/when we return for a holiday in Melbourne."
43429,76253620,2016-05-26,72661248,Chris,"This is a comfortable, charming and secluded apartment.  I received a friendly greeting on arrival, got some tips about the local area, and was then left to enjoy my stay.  To be honest, I was in the area for work so didn't get much time to enjoy the veranda or the garden, but they are every bit as attractive as you see on the photos. "
43429,76659401,2016-05-28,18490086,Mingyao,"Had a great stay, great experience. Complete privacy, clean and pleasant. Feel so welcome by Lizzy and Allan. Exactly the same as photos shown. A highly recommended 5 star stay."

43429,87342689,2016-07-19,65266225,Tri,Lovely place with beautiful garden. Allan contacted us well before we arrived and provided everything we need. Supermarket and buses are a few footsteps away. Highly recommended.
43429,95569273,2016-08-20,66482223,Tony,"Wow what a great place to stay. After a couple of ""average"" Air Bnb experiences, my faith has been totally restored. The studio is advertised very accurately, impeccably clean, private, and comfortable, and great communication. Hosts Allan & Lizzie are very polite, helpful, informative and friendly. They strived to ensure that my stay was perfect. Thanks for the fresh fruit and chocolates etc. I have no hesitation in highly recommending this place to anybody looking for a great place to stay in Melbourne. Thanks Allan & Lizzie."
43429,97446598,2016-08-27,66482223,Tony,"This was my second stay at this great place and once again everything was perfect. Hosts Allan & Lizzie did everything to ensure that my stay was pleasant and comfortable. On the day that I arrived the weather was cold, but the ever conscientious Lizzie had turned the heating on to make sure the studio was warm. When next in Melbourne I will not hesitate to stay here again, hopefully it is available. "
43429,98882160,2016-09-02,76051027,Sylvia,"A mini home away from home. Everything was as described and more. From the bowl of fruit upon arrival ( a delightful and appreciated gesture) to the bookcase full of readable novels, I didn't want for anything. "
43429,101380177,2016-09-13,85842747,Cameron,"We had a lovely stay at Alan's comfortable and well set up studio, when over from Perth for our daughter's 21st. It was ideally situated for us a few minutes walk from Ceitidh's share house it meant we could catch up with her easily. It's close to the freeway and bus to Oakleigh and train to city too which we liked. The studio itself had everything we needed and was ideal for a couple. The real bonus was the alfresco with BBQ and big outdoor setting, which we enjoyed for brunch with C and Melvin. Thanks to Alan and Liz  who. were attentive hosts, keen to ensure we had everything we needed, which definitely was the case! We hope to be back next year!"

43429,112814061,2016-11-07,1742669,Dave,"Great place. Close enough to suburban and city centre attractions. It's great if you have a car, but, if not, there is public transport available nearby. It was our third time to stay at Allan's place - always enjoyable."
43429,114113677,2016-11-15,38573413,Maria,"Everything I can say about this studio was perfect! I came to Australia oversea for the first time and got a lot of help from Allan and Liz. The are very kind, polite and friendly hosts you can only imagine. I got a lot of advises I need to know about Melbourne and Oakleigh. The communication was very fast even between different continents. The place is just awesome! The studio is very neat, clean and fresh. It's well equipped with all things one can need for a short stay. I visited it in November and the garden looked just as a paradise! It's in a very quite and beautiful location. I highly recommend this place and hosts! "
43429,114932099,2016-11-20,99459511,Phillip,The studio is spacious and very private. Everything we required was supplied.

43429,115750170,2016-11-26,56782567,Glen,Very much enjoyed our stay in the studio and Allan and his lovely wife were terrific hosts. Very happy. 
43429,116255427,2016-11-28,24418902,Andrew,"If you are travelling to Clayton / visiting Monash Uni. for whatever reason I don't think you should consider any other place to stay! Honestly one of the best Airbnbs I've stayed at. The studio is a very comfortable size and the layout is nice in the sense that the ""living room"" and ""bedroom"" feel like separate spaces so you can enjoy your book / TV / gaming in one space and then wind down in bed. I didn't have a chance to use the grille on the large enclosed patio, but it appeared to be in tip-top condition. If you have a rental or your own car there is a separate driveway, so very convenient! Very friendly couple and if I have to go back to Monash Uni. I will try and stay here again."
43429,117105589,2016-12-04,20598677,Jacky,"Fantastic stay. Very clean and tidy little place. Hidden at the back along the driveway, 100% privacy! So great and will definitely recommend to everyone."
43429,120501088,2016-12-10,8923361,Alex,"I had a great trip. Staying in Allan's guest house was a dream. It is self contained, with seperate entry so it felt very private. Even a private driveway.

Allen and his wife, Lizzie, were amazing from the start. A guided tour on arrival with great information on the area. Every detail had been taking care of to ensure comfort for their guests. 

I would highly recommend these excellent hosts. They were very friendly and didn't invade privacy at all. 

The place was clean, newly renovated and had all the comforts, snacks, tv, desk etc to make life work easily during my time there. "
43429,120954985,2016-12-12,102061398,Li Yong,An exceptional AirBnB. Allan's place is extremely well equipped and beautiful. Lizzie and Allan are friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Allan's place to everyone's 
43429,124832814,2017-01-02,101658165,Linda," This stay was very peaceful and comfortable. Our host Lizzie (Allan's wife) was so friendly and accommodating, and provided a warm welcome."
43429,127386977,2017-01-17,41959742,Heather,"A lovely little place, exactly as shown on the website. Very clean and well-kept, it was perfect for the two of us. Allan and Lizzy are both lovely and welcoming. They were very helpful in advising on things like public transport and local beaches etc. Peaceful and private, we will definitely stay here again. "
43429,128445073,2017-01-24,30216850,Hilary,"We spent a very comfortable 6 nights in Larry's place.  Lissy met us and showed us around.  The studio is at the back of their house with a nice view of their garden.  It is clean, quiet, spacious and very well appointed, with every little need supplied.  The kitchen was well equipped and we appreciated Lissy's invitation to help ourselves to her vegetable garden!  The Wifi was also excellent.  As pointed out in their description, the bed is a double bed.  We used the bus and train several times to get into the city - very convenient to the house.  We thoroughly recommend their place."
43429,129261600,2017-01-29,20789798,Alex,"Allan and Lizzie were great 'airbnbers'. We had such a lovely time staying in their beautiful home, we really didn't want to leave. The apartment is like a little annex round the back of the main house but has its own drive way and is extremely private. The outdoor space is amazing with a fantastic bbq which was perfect for hosting a few friends for Aussie day! Would reccommend having a car to get around Melbourne and for road trips and things but don't think its essential. Another 10/10 airbnb experience for me. So helpful and would love to come and stay here again in the future!"
43429,130134116,2017-02-04,101454376,明飞,"我们到的很晚,接待我们的是他的妻子,她非常周到地为我们介绍了房子各个设备的用法｡房东夫妻俩很喜欢世界各地有特色的小玩意,院子被打理得像个花园一样美｡房间里还是没有拖鞋,可能就是澳洲酒店的风格吧,厨房里冰箱烤箱微波炉灶台一应俱全,还有两台咖啡机,非常贴心~以后如果有机会希望还能入住这家｡"
43429,130986570,2017-02-09,107696330,Wayne,"我们非常开心住在Allan的房子,植物很多很好看,房间也非常干净,房东Allan也非常耐心和善｡总体来说是一次非常棒的体验"
