\textbf{Subject: Report on Analysis of a Professional Journal Assignment for ENGR-200W.\\}

\noindent Dear Prof. Hsia,

\setlength{\parskip}{\baselineskip}

\noindent I'm pleased to inform you that I've completed the assignment in the above mentioned subject.

\noindent As per the assignment requirements, I selected a technical paper from the journal, \textit {Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Computing Survey}. ACM has the reputation of publishing only peer reviewed articles. ACM publications are highly revered for their content in the computer science and engineering research community.

\noindent My masters specialization is in cybersecurity. My selected paper is from the domain of computer security. The paper which I have analyzed is titled  \textbf{The Evolution of Android Malware and Android Analysis Techniques}. This is a collaborative paper, co-authored by five researchers from the University of London and the University of Malaya.

\noindent The paper provides an insight into malware proliferation in Android operating system from the year 2010 to 2015. Android is the most widely used operating system for mobile devices today. In the memo I cover the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce the journal and the selected technical article
    \item Describe the purpose and summary of the technical article
    \item Describe the problem that the authors of this technical paper try to solve
    \item Explain the methods and apparatus used by the authors to research and solve the problems in this technical paper
    \item Explain the proposed solution by the authors
    \item The conclusion that these authors finally arrive at
    \item The scope of future research work that these authors suggest
\end{itemize}

\noindent I've also written a critique on this paper in my report. In this memo, I have analyzed the paper focusing on the following areas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Readability of the article
    \item Measures of excellence in technical writing
    \item The organization of the paper from the perspectives of grammar, style, flow of the content, readability, and usage of tables and figures
    \item The usefulness of this article in my major
\end{itemize}

% \noindent I want to take this opportunity to let you know that I'm using only \textit{free} and \textit{open source} tools like \LaTeX{}, Vim, Lanugage tools and Linux to create the documents for this assignement.

\noindent I want to thank you for taking the time to read this email and my memo. I look forward to your comments on this assignment. Please reach out to me over email or phone for any questions regarding this submission.


\noindent Sincerely yours,
