title = "DroidScribe: Classifying Android Malware Based on Runtime Behavior",
abstract = "The Android ecosystem has witnessed a surge in malware, which not only puts mobile devices at risk but also increases the burden on malware analysts assessing and catego- rizing threats. In this paper, we show how to use machine learning to automatically classify Android malware samples into families with high accuracy, while observing only their runtime behavior. We focus exclusively on dynamic analysis of runtime behavior to provide a clean point of comparison that is dual to static approaches. Specific challenges in the use of dynamic analysis on Android are the limited information gained from tracking low-level events and the imperfect coverage when testing apps, e.g., due to inactive command and control servers. We observe that on Android, pure system calls do not carry enough semantic content for classification and instead rely on lightweight virtual machine introspection to also reconstruct Android-level inter- process communication. To address the sparsity of data resulting from low coverage, we introduce a novel classification method that fuses Support Vector Machines with Conformal Prediction to generate high-accuracy prediction sets where the information is insufficient to pinpoint a single family.",

title = "Analysis and Classification of Android Malware",
abstract = "With the integration of mobile devices into our daily lives, smartphones are privy to increasing amounts of sensitive information. As of 2016, Android is the leading smartphone in popularity with sophisticated mobile malware targeting its data and services. Thus this thesis attempts to determine how accurate and scalable Android malware analysis and classification methods can be developed to robustly withstand frequent, and substantial, changes within the Android device and in the Android malware ecosystem.First, the author presents a comprehensive survey on leading Android malware analysis and detection techniques, and their effectiveness against evolving malware. Through the systematized survey, the author identifies underdeveloped areas of research which lead to the development of the novel Android malware analysis and classification solutions within in this thesis.This thesis considers the usefulness and feasibility of reconstructing high-level behaviours via system calls intercepted while running Android apps. Previously, this method had only been rudimentarily implemented. However, the author was able to remedy this and developed a robust, novel, framework, to automatically and completely reconstructs all Android malwarebehaviours by thoroughly analysing dynamically captured system calls.Next, the author investigates the efficacy of using our reconstructed behavioural profiles, at different levels of abstractions, to classify Android malware into families. Experiments in this thesis show our reconstructed behaviours to be more effective, and efficient, than raw system call traces. To classify malware, we utilized support vector machines to achieve high accuracy, precision and recall. Deviating from previous methods, we further apply statistical classification to achieve near-perfect accuracies.Finally, the author explores an alternative Android malware analysis method using memory forensics. By extrapolating from these experiments, the author theorizes how to use this method to assist in capturing behaviours our previous methods could not, and how they could assist classification.",

title = "CopperDroid: Automatic Reconstruction of Android Malware Behaviors",
abstract = "Mobile devices and their application marketplaces drive the entire economy of the today’s mobile landscape. Android platforms alone have produced staggering revenues, exceeding five billion USD, which has attracted cybercriminals and increased malware in Android markets at an alarming rate. To better understand this slew of threats, we present CopperDroid, an automatic VMI-based dynamic analysis system to reconstruct the behaviors of Android malware. The novelty of CopperDroid liesin its agnostic approach to identify interesting OS- and high-level Android-specific behaviors. It reconstructs these behaviors by observing and dissecting system calls and, therefore, is resistant to the multitude of alterations the Android runtime is subjected to over its life-cycle. CopperDroid automatically and accurately reconstructs events of interest that describe, not only well-known process-OS interactions (e.g., file and process creation), but also complex intra- and inter-process communications (e.g., SMS reception), whose semantics are typically contextualized through complex Android objects. Because CopperDroid’s reconstructionmechanisms are agnostic to the underlying action invocation methods, it is able to capture actions initiated both from Java and native code execution. CopperDroid’s analysis generates detailed behavioral profiles that abstract a large stream of low-level—often uninteresting—events into concise, high-level semantics, which are well-suited to provide insightful behavioral traits and open the possibility to further research directions. We carried out an extensive evaluation to assess the capabilities and performance of CopperDroid on more than 2,900 Android malware samples. Our experiments show that CopperDroid faithfully reconstructs OSand Android-specific behaviors. Additionally, we demonstrate how CopperDroid can be leveraged to disclose additional behaviors through the use of a simple, yet effective, app stimulation technique. Using this technique, we successfully triggered and disclosed additional behaviors on more than 60{\%} of the analyzed malware samples. This qualitatively demonstrates the versatility of CopperDroid’s ability to improve dynamic-based code coverage.",

abstract="Mobile devices have become a significant part of people's lives, leading to an increasing number of users involved with such technology. The rising number of users invites hackers to generate malicious applications. Besides, the security of sensitive data available on mobile devices is taken lightly. Relying on currently developed approaches is not sufficient, given that intelligent malware keeps modifying rapidly and as a result becomes more difficult to detect. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to evaluating malware detection using the anomaly-based approach with machine learning classifiers. Among the various network traffic features, the four categories selected are basic information, content based, time based and connection based. The evaluation utilizes two datasets: public (i.e. MalGenome) and private (i.e. self-collected). Based on the evaluation results, both the Bayes network and random forest classifiers produced more accurate readings, with a 99.97 {\%} true-positive rate (TPR) as opposed to the multi-layer perceptron with only 93.03 {\%} on the MalGenome dataset. However, this experiment revealed that the k-nearest neighbor classifier efficiently detected the latest Android malware with an 84.57 {\%} true-positive rate higher than other classifiers.",
