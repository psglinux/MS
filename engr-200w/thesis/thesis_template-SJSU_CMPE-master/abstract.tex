In cybersecurity, risk management is a dominant topic today. Comprehensive cyber regulations like, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in European Union (EU) and California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) in California are tightening the grip on every company with cyber infrastructure. Security experts and Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) are looking at cyber risk management to comply with cyber laws and to minimize impact of cyber attacks. Security engineers struggle to create inventory of cyber assets and evaluate their risk profiles and vulnerabilities. There is no software available to automate inventorying of cyber assets, classify their risk profiles, and perform risk management on them. In this thesis I intend to create an algorithm to rank the vulnerability of assets in an organization using stochastic methods and provide a risk management tool. I review technical papers to identify a set of cyber assets that are most common in an enterprise network, evaluate if Markov process is the right mathematical model to derive the ranking algorithm, and derive the foundational mathematical equations for the ranking algorithm.
