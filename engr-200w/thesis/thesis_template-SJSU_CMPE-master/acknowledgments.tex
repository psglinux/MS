I would like to thank my advisors Dr. Younghee Park, Prof. Kaikai Liu, Ph.D., and Prof. Vikrant Nanda, M.S., for their encouragement and support while working on this thesis. I would also like to thank Prof. David C. Anastasiu, SJSU, for creating this LaTeX template and ensuring that it accurately follows the graduate studies thesis style requirements. Last, but not least, I would like to thank my wife Gargi Ghosh Hazra; without her support, I would not have been able to pursue graduate studies. Finally, I would like to thank my parents for all that they have done to support me financially during my early education with all their hardships.
