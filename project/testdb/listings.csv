Extremely conveniently, the #48 tram will take you to/from the Melbourne Airport shuttle (SkyBus) and the #75 to Etihad stadium. On a sunny day, I prefer to stroll into the city - virtually a straight line down Bridge Road, past the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground, through the beautiful Fitzroy Gardens (home to Captain Cook's Cottage and the gorgeous Conservatory).

Be aware that if you have a full bore water pressure shower, the hot water will probably only last 10 minutes, which should be more than enough. Water restrictions have been very strict in Melbourne over the past decade but I would hope that my kind of guests are conscientious of water wastage regardless! All we ask is that you respect our home, as you would expect of visitors in your own home. Easy.

Fitzroy has very diverse residents; shops; bars, cafes and restaurants; all services; and interesting streetscapes. There are beautiful parks and gardens nearby, plus museums and galleries. It's very walkable and bike friendly. Most buildings are low rise, one or two stories, even though its only ten minutes walk to the centre of the city. In the Guidebook I have listed a few on my favourite local places - though I'm sure you'll find your own just by wandering around. Sometimes these inner city neighbourhoods can be noisy, but the townhouse is in a street with very little through traffic. During the day there is some activity because the house borders an office and commercial precinct.","There is a printer and a scanner which you can use, subject to a fair use policy. Please see the Guidebook for more details after you make your booking.","Public transport is excellent - three tram routes within a few minutes walk, and a CBD train station ten minutes walk to take you anywhere in the city. There are two Myki cards (the local public transport smart card) for guest use (these need to be recharged in a local shop). There is no on site parking, but there is unrestricted street parking in front of the house. The main car rental offices are 20 minutes walk or 10 minutes taxi ride in the central city.

My wife Stacey and I have some amazing places in Melbourne and the Yarra Valley that we'd love to share with you. 

We have a stunning (circa 1854) converted stables in St Kilda, which is very close to Fitzroy and Acland Streets, the beach and many awesome cafes and restaurants and the Albert Park Formula One circuit. We have two stunning Art Deco apartments in the Botanic Garden’s precinct in Melbourne, which are close to the best of everything that Melbourne is famous for – shopping with Chapel St (South Yarra), Toorak Rd (South Yarra) & Bridge Rd (Richmond) all within walking distance to the best sports grounds in Australia including the MCG, Australian Open Tennis Arena, Melbourne Formula 1 Grand Prix and CBD all within 2 klms. South Yarra and the CBD have many of the best bars and restaurants and in typical Melbourne style you’ll have to scour the backstreets and laneways to find them.

Healesville Country House is our beautiful 5 bedroom home in the Yarra Valley, it is a former guesthouse circa 1900 that we've lovingly restored and created a family home from. We are two minutes from the main street and 5-10 minutes from some of the world's best wineries. It is the perfect place for unwinding with plenty of outdoor spaces including a pool and verandahs boasting some of the best views around.

Check out our profile for additional information and pictures. We're really happy to recommend our favourite restaurants, cafes and places to see.

I would like to dispel the myths of current medical thinking and inspire our systems to work on the cause rather than just the symptoms. Preventative medicine is not just about screening physical bodies but need to address underlying dis-ease ( lack of ease) in our emotions, mind and spirit).

An exciting area with a focus on the visual and performing arts, food, fashion and independant retail. It takes about five/ten minutes to walk to the city and is close to the major hospitals and universities, Melbourne Museum and the Exhibition Building. Twenty minute walk to the Victoria Market, or a tram ride. Thirty minutes to Collingwood Children's Farm and artist's/farmer's markets. Much has been said of Brunswick St, running down the middle of Fitzroy and it's unique atmosphere and galleries, venues, bars and cafes. Gertrude St was the first block outside the city to be sub-divided and has many bluestone buildings from the 1860's that now house quirky be-spoke designer makers and ""stand alone"" retailers ...from men's hats at SMART, Alec to organic bread at Fatto a Mano. Gertrude St Projection Festival transforms the street in winter annually. Smith St epitomizes the incredible blend of cultures that call Fitzr","You should be aware the house is over three levels, open plan and there are stairs. It is made of bluestone and recycled materials, was once an old stable, so quirky and atmospheric...not your average dwelling!","A tram on every corner! The Smith/Gertrude Sts tram, the number 86 takes you down Bourke St into town. The Brunswick St tram, number 11, takes you down Collins St into town and to Docklands. The Nicholson St tram, number 96 takes you all the way to St. Kilda. Two minutes walk to Victoria Parade trams and buses.  Five minute walk to Johnston St buses. If you are driving we have on street parking,so it is sometimes difficult to find a spot. Better to use the many forms of public transport around us. A cab to the airport takes between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the traffic. Or catch a tram into the city and the airport bus from there. To get to Southern Cross Station (Spencer st station) take the Smith/Gertrude St tram number 86.","You will have the whole house to yourselves and your entrance is separate from ours.

Most of the people I am surrounded by are making a positive difference in the world or are on a spiritual or personal growth journey of some kind. 

I love my work and work for myself. I am a Film Producer, working on a global film collaboration project. We are producing a psycho-spiritual film to inspire the audience to discover what it takes to live your life everyday  in love and joy.

I value heart felt, emotionally intimate connections with friends and associates. I enjoy people. I love going out listening to music, theatre and dancing. I am fit, eat heathily, don't work too hard these days and appreciate being outdoors in nature.

On my bookshelves you will find mostly find books on psychology, spirituality, health, business & money.

The best holiday I had was being in Cuba for one month with a women from Calgary who I had met the year before in Thailand. Our trip to Cuba cemented a lifelong friendship. I love the music and dance in Cuba and the simplicity of life. I also love being in Paris. I will always remember my first day in Paris because I was awestruck by the beauty all around me plus I always feel romantic when I am in Paris. Needless to say, romantic comedy is one of my favourite film genres.

I used to be an adrenaline junkie but I am so pleased to say that gone are the days of busyness, gone are the days of being addicted to activity and stress and gone are the days of covering up feelings of not being good enough with over achievement. Phew!! That's a relief. 

Today, my life is peaceful, joyful and mostly serene and whilst there are some limits, I have managed to achieve a certain amount of freedom about how I spend each day. 

One of my philisophies on life is, ""People do the best they can in any given moment. And whilst at times that best may not feel so great, it is that person's best in that moment.""

Firstly the airport trip is around 25 minutes in a cab which until Melbourne airport link arrives is the best transport option for a group. Secondly there is a tram stop outside the front door for the number 1 tram - takes around 6 minutes into Federation square.

The area has plenty of cafes and bars, lots of artists and musicians live in the area and there is an active live local music scene.

The only reason I occasionally host guests from airbnb is because it provides an opportunity to meet interesting people from around the world.  Therefore, I will look at your profile, to see how you have described yourself and any partner you might be travelling with, to make my decision.  Airbnb stays are very different from staying in a hotel.............. and you need to understand this as a prospective guest.

My experiences with airbnb have been fantastic and I have met people I will know for the rest of my life.  Interesting, happy, engaging, respectful and cat friendly people who have understood how to share the house and amenities.

I am a musician and engineer and interested in finding solutions to climate change.

In my music work, I love singing, playing bass and performing. I do everything from performing at weddings, to parties, to busking (which I love).

I enjoy traveling  and exploring cities of the world, whether in Australia or overseas (Europe especially beguiling - London, Paris, Berlin). 

I am into sustainability, pretty relaxed and easygoing, don't smoke, and enjoy meeting up with friends for coffee and films  :)

Currently based in Melbourne. I love most creative audio and visual forms and have dabbled in quite a few throughout my career.

My wife Elizabeth and I met and married in Hong Kong before moving back to Melbourne in 2014. 

We have a passion for Movies, animation, great art exhibitions, writing, food made with heart and wandering aimlessly around new cities. 

I have travelled a lot through my work and just randomly. My favourite places include The Greek Islands, Istanbul, NYC, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Italy, Ticino in Switzerland, Peru and Fiji. :)   

I travel as lightly as I can having developed a keen skill for it over the years of touring in my band.

Though I have been a long-time Rock Musician I neither drink (haven't done for years) and have never been a smoker. I like to rebel against the rebels ;)

We have a two year old son called Cassius who keeps us on our toes and up at night. 

When I am a guest in other's houses I always try to be careful and respectful of their space and belongings. I own an apartment in the Melbourne CBD which I have rented out fully furnished to nice people before so I know how important mutual respect is in these situations (Website hidden by Airbnb)
